Day-to-day life as a graduate student may be very different from what you are used to.  
That is both a challenge and an opportunity.

While master’s degree students may feel a bit like undergraduates (the graduate courses for a master’s degree can be similar to senior-level technical electives), PhD students often feel quite different, focusing primarily on research rather than courses.  
In addition, graduate school is usually in a new town (and often in a new country!) and feelings of [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) are common.

On the positive side, graduate school often involves significantly more day-to-day freedom than the undergraduate experience. Many graduate students report first feeling like a “real adult” in graduate school: greater freedom, greater responsibility, and a decreased reliance on family all contribute to that sentiment.

{% include quote.html content="The daily schedule of a PhD student can vary a lot from person to person, and lab to lab. For example, I tend to work between 10–6, but take a long lunch break, and I’ll sometimes continue working at my leisure in the evenings or weekends. This is how I prefer to work (pacing myself at about 75% capacity over 5–6 days instead of pushing 100% for 5 days), since that gives me a lot of flexibility and some downtime during the week. As long as I meet my deadlines, I’m not required to follow a strict 9–5. That said, some people prefer a more traditional routine to maintain clearer boundaries between work and life, and some labs may set different expectations for their students." user="danni" %}

## Semesters

During the two main semesters each year (Fall and Spring), master’s degree students and junior PhD students primarily take graduate courses, while senior PhD students work on research projects.  
Graduate students almost always have a desk in a shared lab in the computer science building. Master’s degree students typically have total freedom to work from home or from the office.  
PhD students typically work out expectations about in-person attendance for certain activities (e.g., group research meetings) with their advisors.

A full-time graduate student teaching assistant works 20 hours per week as a teaching assistant.  
Although a standard “full-time job” in the U.S. is 40 hours per week, a full-time graduate student TA position is 20 hours per week.  
The “other 20 hours” are then spent on graduate coursework and pursuing research.  
Similarly, a PhD student paid as a full-time research assistant does 20 hours of research work per week on paper (and then typically spends the “other 20 hours” on research as well).  
When we talk about a graduate student being fully funded (tuition, health insurance, and stipend), that is associated with 20 hours of paid work per week.

{% include quote.html content="Graduate school is often 'bursty'. Even if the average is 40 hours per week, many weeks, such as those near paper submission deadlines, may involve significantly more work and more hours. Other weeks, such as those after a deadline, or some weeks during the summer, involve much less." user="weimer" %}

While requirements vary from program to program, master’s degree students typically complete 6–10 courses.  
For example, the University of Michigan CSE division requires 24 graduate credits and most graduate courses are 3 credits each, for a total of 8 courses.  
A student could complete these in four semesters (2+2+2+2) or three semesters (2+3+3), and a student who completed one or two courses while completing the undergraduate degree could finish the rest in two semesters (in a five-year bachelor’s + master’s program).  

Not all courses are offered every semester, and you often have to take courses from different categories (e.g., at least one Theory course, at least one Hardware course, etc.), so it sometimes takes one more semester than you might think.  
Overall, a common day-to-day experience for a master’s student might be “three more semesters of taking rigorous courses.”

Junior PhD students also take classes but may take them at a slower rate while working on research simultaneously.  
In contrast to undergraduate or most master’s degrees where coursework is essential, **research progress** is the most important task for progressing through a PhD program.

## Summers

Summers can be very productive times in graduate school.  
Most undergraduate students are away, and graduate classes are rarely offered during the summer.  
Master’s degree students often pursue a paid, external internship during the summer (and students in a five-year bachelor’s + master’s program may not have a summer in graduate school at all).  
PhD students typically stay during the summer to work on research without distractions but may also go on external internships or travel to conferences to present publications and network.

## Vacations

Graduate students have a significant amount of flexibility regarding when they work.  
Master’s students can schedule their time however they like as long as they are passing classes; they typically leave for Winter holidays and other breaks.  
Similarly, most advisors care more about whether or not PhD-track students are producing high-quality work on time than whether you happen to be in the office on a particular day.

Graduate school work hours often vary per week, and after pushing for a course project or paper submission deadline, graduate students often take time off so things “even out” and work–life balance is maintained.

Graduate students paid by the program often have particular obligations.  
For example, a paid teaching assistant may be required to help grade a final exam before leaving.  
Similarly, a research assistant may be expected to attend certain group meetings or help submit a paper before vacation.  

We strongly recommend that paid graduate students discuss these obligations early with their advisors or supervisors.  
Some programs provide structured worksheets with good initial questions (e.g., expectations for meetings, vacations, or authorship for publications).  
You can—and should—ask these questions even if your program doesn’t provide a formal structure.

## Stress and Feeling Overwhelmed

Graduate school is often a period of transition, full of firsts both personally and professionally.  
Throughout the program, students are busy with coursework or research while also dealing with significant uncertainty (“Will I get this internship? Will my research produce interesting results?”).  
Together, this can lead graduate students to experience stress and feel overwhelmed.  
At the same time, graduate school can be a great place to learn more about yourself, what you like to do, and who you want to be.

If you experience stress in graduate school, you are not alone.  
Many students find that taking breaks, maintaining work–life balance, and building a support network of mentors and friends can help.  
Most graduate programs also have student organizations and clubs that support community and mental health.

## Time Management

Graduate school often involves multiple independent tasks and an expectation that you keep up with all of them on your own.  
For example, a first-year PhD student might be taking graduate-level courses, grading as a TA, and working on a research project—all at once.  
In theory, this isn’t so different from undergrad; in practice, the open-ended nature of tasks makes it harder to know when to start or stop.

{% include quote.html content="It's very easy to stay on one task until it feels perfect or to refuse to start the next task because it depends on finishing something else. But the reality is, if you want any kind of life balance, you have to get comfortable moving forward with unfinished work, leaving yourself FIXMEs, and doing things not as pretty as you'd like. What worked for me has changed over time. Early on, I used Clockify to track how much I was actually working. Turns out, it was way more than I thought: not just doing the work, but thinking about work, organizing work, worrying about work. Eventually, I found it more useful to keep multiple to-do lists: monthly, weekly, daily list. The biggest advice I have is being flexible. Treat your plan like a living document. Check in with yourself. Adapt. You’re a person, not a productivity machine." user="priscila" %}

## Self Confidence and Imposter Syndrome

[Imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is almost universal among graduate students and applicants.  
Many students compare their worst attributes to the combination of others’ best ones—forgetting that everyone has tradeoffs between research, coursework, and teaching.  
Students who publish papers but have lower GPAs worry; those with strong grades but no research also worry.

## Mental Health

A meta-review found that around one-fourth of PhD students report symptoms of clinically significant depression, and one-fifth report symptoms of clinical anxiety ([Nature Scientific Reports, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93687-7)).

{% include quote.html content="Living with generalized anxiety disorder in grad school is like being on a spinning wheel that won’t slow down. You are trying to get it to slow down, but every measure you take somehow makes it spin faster... Therapy has been a lifesaver, and I’ve found medication manageable and affordable with grad school insurance. As a PhD student, I pay little to nothing for ongoing care." user="priscila" %}

{% include quote.html content="International students often push themselves very hard. I’ve felt guilty even about sleeping longer, but that mindset leads to burnout. You may feel like you’re not doing enough, but often that’s not true. You are working hard already. Remember that your health comes first. Even if things don’t work out at times, it’s often the situation, not you. Work hard, yes, but don’t let setbacks define your worth." user="sathvika" %}

## Housing and New Towns

For many students—especially international and first-generation students—moving to a new college town and building an independent life can be daunting.  
Culture shock is real, and daily routines (shopping, transportation, communication) may differ drastically from what you’re used to.

{% include quote.html content="Life here is different for each student. At my graduate program (the University of Michigan), it is both competitive and supportive. There will be highs and lows. You might think you were really good at something, but that might change here because courses are more rigorous and you’ll likely need to work harder than you did in your home country. For Indian students in particular, this adjustment is very real." user="sathvika" %}

{% include quote.html content="Moving into an apartment alone was quite jarring after my experience living in a cooperative house in undergrad. I played videos on my TV and phone while cooking and cleaning because I felt lonely... Things are better now – I have a cat, put more sentimental items and art around the house, and grew to appreciate my privacy to a greater extent." user="kaia" %}

## Overall Reflections 

Graduate school is not “easy,” but it’s more of a **marathon than a sprint**.  
The University of Michigan CSE’s 2020–21 climate report found that students rated faculty/student relationships as “good” and overall satisfaction as “somewhat satisfied” ([source](https://cse-climate.engin.umich.edu/reports/committee-reports/graduate-student-check-in-report-2020-21/#quantitative)).

{% include quote.html content="Your particular level of day-to-day happiness depends much more on factors such as: alignment with program culture, advisor communication, and how well your program supports your mental health. Applying widely and using visit days to gather this information can help you make a better decision." user="weimer" %}
