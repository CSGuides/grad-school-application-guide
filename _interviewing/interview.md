# Grad School Interviews You

After you have submitted your applications (usually by December 15th), you may start to hear back from schools or professors. In terms of timelines, this almost never happens over winter break directly (faculty committee members are on holiday), sometimes happens in January, and frequently happens by February. (Do not panic if you haven’t heard as early as some of your peers. See elsewhere in this guide for a discussion of risks and mistakes.) 

In rarer cases, a school or professor may simply offer you admission into a graduate program. However, it is increasingly common, in PhD admissions, for someone on the committee or a research advisor to reach out to you to chat over a video- or phone- call. To avoid making you nervous, they will probably not refer to this as an “interview”, but it may be helpful to think of it as one.

The purpose of the interview is almost always to help the decision-maker make a final decision among the last few top candidates. For example, a faculty member might have funding for two graduate students and might interview the top four to see which two are the best fit.

And I mostly thought that when I got interview invitations, they would be really casual and I would talk about my research, which I thought I knew really well. Although I got many interviews, in most of them the experience was different from what I expected. Since I had not prepared myself to answer technical questions outside my research or even within my research, I was not able to convince them that I had a strong fundamental knowledge. After a couple of interviews went badly, I practiced more and eventually was able to do better. But I suggest preparing for interviews, since it's the last step to getting accepted.

**Master’s Applications**

If you applied for a coursework-based computer science masters program, it is unlikely that you will have an interview. Most decisions are made from your application materials alone. The one exception is that if you are a non-native English speaker, you may be asked to do a quick phone interview regarding your English proficiency (we describe these more below).

If you applied for a research-based (thesis) masters, you might get called in for an interview. These interviews will likely be more similar to the PhD interviews discussed below, but likely less intense.


**PhD Applications**

 Interviews are fairly common for PhD applications. Getting an interview invitation likely means that the school is interested in your application. However, it is important to note that this is a one-way indicator: you can still be accepted to a PhD program without an interview (for example, Madeline only had interviews at about half of the schools she was ultimately accepted to).

Interviews are generally conducted remotely over phone or video conference. There are three types of interviews you might encounter:

1. Language-proficiency screening
2. Departmental Interview
3. Interviews with specific faculty who might want to hire you

In some situations, you may have more than one interview for a single school. We detail each interview type in turn.

*Language Proficiency Screening:* In some cases, the focus of the interview may be spoken language proficiency. For example, Wes Weimer worked at a state university where there was a state law mandating certain levels of English proficiency for student-facing teaching assistants (as in the [Test of English as a Foreign Language, or TOEFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_of_English_as_a_Foreign_Language)). Because the department wanted graduate students to be able to work as teaching assistants, it would assess their English proficiency. During the interview, students were evaluated on their ability to give clear explanations and directions in English. (If memory serves, an indicative question was along the lines of “You are entering a grocery store and someone stops you and asks for step-by-step instructions about where to find the eggs. What do you say?” Something like “They’re in the back of the store” would be probed for more detail: interviewers were looking for a logical, coherent sequence of instructions and references.) This type of interview is rarer and will typically be clearly explained in advance. 

*Departmental Interview:* Most departments have a designated faculty committee for reviewing applications. The faculty on this committee can vary year from year. In addition, committees can run PhD admissions in different ways. You may also receive an interview from a faculty member who liked your application but is not directly in your area. It is common for departments and committees to spread out the time cost of conducting interviews across multiple faculty. 

*Specific Faculty Interview:* This is the most common type of grad school interview. Faculty members who reach out will often, but not always, be one of the professors you listed in your application essays or on the submission web-form (see elsewhere in this guide for the  internal view). Interview length varies, but they are generally from 20 minutes to an hour in length. Every once and a while, you may be asked to prepare a set of slides or similar formal description of your work.

In most cases, the focus of the interview will be on determining if you and the advisor (or you and the department) have a good fit. 

{% include quote.html content="Occasionally, faculty considering a specific student will also reach out to letter writers for more information. I’ve had professors I know at other schools contact me when they see one of my recommendations. Much like student interviews, these conversations are used to gauge whether there might be a good advisor fit or if the student has the needed background knowledge for a research topic.

## How Can I Prepare for a PhD Interview?

In most cases, the professor or department’s goal in the interview is the same: to determine if you are a low-risk, high-reward candidate who is aligned with a relevant research or lab objective and who is pleasant to work with. In some rarer cases, professors might have particular information needs (e.g., a professor might have a grant with a particular deliverable, such as a piece of software that must be written, and may only be in a position to admit students who are willing to do that specific work to be funded by that specific grant). 

In our experience, professors often perceive that they can gain a wealth of information from a few simple questions in a personal interview. That is because both your answers themselves, and also the manner in which you deliver them, convey information. A professor might ask you to explain the research project you described in your application essay in your own words. Applicants who understand their projects well tend to offer coherent, well-organized explanations (often mimicking the structure of a scientific paper). Applicants who were not as involved in the research or lack an interwoven understanding of it often struggle. At the same time, the manner in which you respond to the question conveys other information. Are you enthusiastic about the work? Are you clear and articulate? Would you make a good teaching assistant? And so on. 


While there is high variance between professors, common personal PhD interview questions or prompts include:

- Your application mentioned that you worked on X. Could you describe that in your own words?
- Which parts of that project did you work on most directly? What was the hardest part or detail, and how did you address it?
- Tell me a little bit about yourself. 
- What do you want to do going forward? Why do you want to work in this lab? 
- Here are some projects I am working on. Which one of these sounds the most appealing to you?  
- What do you know about Topic/Technique X? 

The first three questions in that list are about you and your work, and the best preparation is to practice giving an [“elevator pitch”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) for your own work. Your undergraduate professors can help you prepare or practice for this aspect. This preparation tends to be universal to all interviews rather than specific to a particular school. Computer Science professors are trained to expect certain key pieces of information in these brief summaries often called the [Heilmeier Catechism](https://techtransferfordefense.stanford.edu/creating-impactful-one-pagers-using-heilmeier-catechism) (it is the same scaffolding used across papers, presentations, funding applications, etc.). Being able to give 1-2 sentence answers to questions 1-4 and 8 in the linked article will make your description of a project clear, concise, and memorable. (You’ll also notice these questions show up throughout our suggestions in this section.)

The final questions are more about the potential advisor’s research. The advisor is looking for students who will fit into existing and future research projects. You benefit by showing that (1) you understand what that work is about, (2) you are qualified and prepared to assist, and (3) you are interested in the topic. 


As a result, your preparation for this is typically specific to each school. In a broad outline, we recommend: 

1. Go to the professor’s webpage. In most cases, you will have already looked at the professor’s webpage when you were choosing where to apply. At this point, you will revisit the webpage and be even more thorough. 
1. Look up some of the papers that they’ve published in the last few years, and pick 1-3 of your favorite ones. For each, read through and skim the paper, and pre-write answers for the following:
    1. What problem are they trying to solve and why is it important?
    1. How do they solve it, and why is their solution better than the state of the art?
    1. What is one thing you like about the work?
    1. What is one thing you’d be interested in adding to the work, or a lingering question that you have? How could your interests or skills mesh with their research? We encourage you to think out of the box — it’s ok if the connection feels tenuous to you!
        1. At a high level, suggesting that you would do the same work again but evaluate it on a larger benchmark is typically not compelling. By contrast, suggesting that you would lift an input assumption of the work, or strengthen the work to provide additional guarantees, is more compelling. Most new projects are made by combining insights or techniques. Perhaps the professor has been making a series of tools or type systems that improve programming, and your undergraduate work included a human study. You might suggest publishing a human study of the benefits of the professor’s tools, and then using those results to guide the design of the next generation type system. 
    1. If you aren’t able to understand their papers, that’s ok! Try and pick those that closest match your own expertise. You can also talk with your primary advisor at your current institution if you have questions while reading.
1. Look at the other parts of the professor’s website:
    1. Do they have any hobbies or interests that you also like?
    1. Do they have a mentoring plan on their web page?
    1. How many past students have they had? Where did they go after the PhD?
1. Throughout, take note of any questions that you have and write them down. It is totally legitimate (and recommended!) that you bring notes to an interview. For example, Emma Shedden used a template to help her prepare for each of her faculty interviews, available here. We recommend that you write down notes for some questions they might have for you, as well as write down some questions that you have for them.

Students might worry about discussing weaknesses in a paper written by the professor (will they get offended?) despite this being an opportunity to demonstrate critical thinking. Rather than stating, “a weakness of the paper is X,” you could instead raise this as a question about the paper:
- Is a limitation of this approach that it doesn’t apply to problems of type X?
- What would happen if we didn’t assume Y?
- Has anyone tried doing Z?

Knowing what questions might be asked is definitely helpful. However, it can still be hard to construct a strong answer even if you know the question in advance. Here are some strategies you can use when answering questions

- Restate the question to the author to confirm you heard correctly – make sure you are actually answering what they asked! It is particularly easy to misinterpret “why” or “how” questions. Professors will often ask questions of the form “Why did you use X to do Y?” The professor often intends the focus to be on one of those parts (X or Y), but you may interpret the question as being about the other.
    - For example, a professor might ask “Why did you use a generalized linear mixed model to analyze program correctness?” You might view the question as being about the choice of analysis model, in which case a good answer might be to contrast against a simpler analysis and explain why it was inadequate.  “Why did we use a GLMM? Oh, because our pilot study suggested both fixed and random effects, such as blah blah, and so a simple linear regression, while perhaps easier to interpret, would not suffice.” But perhaps the professor was viewing the question as being about the subject of the analysis! Something more like: “Why did you analyze program correctness instead of analyzing program speed?” Many research results involve the use of hammer X on nail Y (or strategy X on problem Y). When a professor asks why you used X on Y, it is often good to clarify whether the question is “Why did you use X on problem Y1 instead of on problem Y2?” or “Why did you use strategy X1 to solve problem Y, instead of using strategy X2?” 
- Take your time. Pausing is entirely acceptable. A five-second pause to gather your thoughts may feel, subjectively, like an eternity of silence. In practice, the professor likely won’t notice at all (most professors are used to asking questions in class to which they know the answers but the students do not, and are thus used to students taking a little longer to answer) or will probably think more highly of you for being deliberate and rigorous rather than rushing in. 
- Write down notes. This has many benefits. If you receive multiple offers, notes can help you remember what you liked or disliked about an interview or candidate advisor. Notes can also buy you a little bit of time: if you are clearly taking notes longhand, that provides an “excuse” for why you are taking an extra second or two before responding. Finally, taking notes typically flatters the professor.


{% include quote.html content=" I joke that taking notes during an advising meeting supports the flattering fiction that what I am saying is worth remembering. Imagine I am interviewing two otherwise-identical applicants and the first takes notes on the interview meeting (which includes discussions of research and how we would work together) but the second does not. Who will I see as the lower-risk candidate, the applicant more likely  to take notes in future meetings and thus more likely to keep track of obligations and advice?

## What Can You Ask?

You may have the opportunity to ask a question or two at the end of the interview. Some professors explicitly leave time for this. If you are talking to someone generic from the department who is not a potential advisor, this is slightly less important: students often ask questions about decision timelines and reaffirm that they are very interested. If you are talking to a potential advisor, this is an opportunity to show that you are invested in graduate school and to get useful information. 

All other things being equal, asking about the professor’s mentoring style can be a good choice. UMich has a list of candidate questions ([and many professors answer them](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/mentor/weimerw)); we repeat the some relevant ones here as suggestions: 
- How would you describe your advising style? Does your approach vary over the course of a student's progress within their degree?
- How often do you plan to meet with students one-on-one (be as specific as possible, it's okay to describe multiple styles that may vary with student needs)? Is an agenda required? How long are meetings?
- Do you have regular group meetings? What does student participation look like in a group meeting? 
- How do you decide authorship and/or authorship order? 
- Do you ask students in your group to serve as teaching assistants over the course of their program?
