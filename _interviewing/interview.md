# Grad School Interviews You

After you have submitted your applications (usually by **December 15th**), you may start to hear back from schools or professors. This almost never happens over winter break directly, sometimes happens in **January**, and frequently happens by **February**.  
Do not panic if you haven’t heard as early as some of your peers—see elsewhere in this guide for a discussion of risks and timing.

In rarer cases, a school or professor may simply offer you admission. However, it is increasingly common, especially in PhD admissions, for someone on the committee or a potential research advisor to reach out for a brief video or phone call. They might not call it an “interview,” but it helps to treat it as one.

The purpose of the interview is to help decision-makers choose among the final few candidates. For example, a faculty member might have funding for two graduate students and interview four.

I wasn’t ready for technical questions outside my research and struggled to show my fundamental knowledge. After practicing, I improved—but I suggest preparing for interviews, since it’s the last step to getting accepted." user="serra" %}

### Master’s Applications

If you applied to a **coursework-based** master’s program, an interview is unlikely. Most decisions come directly from your materials.  
However, non-native English speakers may be asked to do a short phone interview to assess English proficiency.

If you applied to a **research-based (thesis)** master’s, you might have an interview similar to those for PhD programs but generally less intense.

### PhD Applications

Interviews are fairly common for PhD applicants and typically signal serious interest.  
However, you can still be admitted without one—some accepted students only had interviews at half of their schools.

## Types of Graduate School Interviews

1. **Language-Proficiency Screening**  
2. **Departmental Interview**  
3. **Interview with Specific Faculty**

You may have more than one interview per school.

#### Language-Proficiency Screening

Some schools use interviews to assess spoken English proficiency, especially if teaching assistantships are common. For example, students might be asked to explain how to find something in a store step-by-step to assess clarity and coherence.  
These interviews are rare and typically announced in advance.

#### Departmental Interview

A committee member may interview you even if they aren’t in your subfield. This distributes workload and helps evaluate fit more broadly.

#### Specific Faculty Interview

This is the **most common type**. The interviewer is often a professor you mentioned in your essays. Interviews typically last 20–60 minutes and may occasionally involve presenting slides.  
The focus is on **fit**—between you and the advisor, and between your interests and the lab’s work.

These conversations are used to gauge whether there might be a good advisor fit or if the student has the needed background knowledge for a research topic." user="weimer" %}

## How Can I Prepare for a PhD Interview?

Professors are usually evaluating whether you are a **low-risk, high-reward** candidate aligned with their lab’s goals. They may also have specific needs tied to funding or project deliverables.

Be prepared to **explain your research** clearly and concisely. You may be asked to summarize your past projects, highlight your contributions, and discuss what you want to do next.  
Practice an “elevator pitch” for your research. You can use the *Heilmeier Catechism* questions to structure it.

Common interview questions include:

- “Your application mentioned that you worked on X. Could you describe that in your own words?”  
- “Which parts of that project did you work on most directly?”  
- “What do you want to do going forward? Why do you want to work in this lab?”  
- “What do you know about Topic/Technique X?”

You can prepare by researching each potential advisor’s recent papers and noting:

- What problem they’re solving and why it matters  
- How they solve it and what’s new  
- What you like about the work  
- How your skills or interests might connect to it  

If you can’t follow every paper, that’s okay—focus on what overlaps most with your experience.

### Tips During the Interview

- **Restate the question** to confirm you understood it.  
- **Take your time**—a brief pause is fine.  
- **Take notes**—it helps you remember details and signals attentiveness.

If I interview two identical applicants and one takes notes, I see them as lower-risk—the kind who will stay organized and follow advice." user="weimer" %}

## What Can You Ask?

If time allows, you can ask about mentoring style, lab culture, and student experiences.  
UMich faculty use a “mentor questionnaire” — you might adapt some of these questions:

- “How would you describe your advising style?”  
- “How often do you meet with students one-on-one?”  
- “How do you decide authorship?”  
- “Do your students usually teach during the program?”
