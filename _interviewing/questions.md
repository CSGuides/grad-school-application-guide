# Individual Meeting Questions

As mentioned [above](#the-different-types-of-interview-meetings),
the majority of your interview will consist of one-on-one sessions 
with senior researchers or faculty members you've likely never met before. 
Expect the worst-case scenario: you
will have to fill the entire 30-60 minutes yourself by asking questions. 
To help, here are some questions (and follow-ups) that at least one of 
us has asked during interviews, along with typical responses you might encounter:

**Questions you can ask:**

Generally, try to have a set of questions lined up. For two days,
people will repeatedly ask you if you have questions for them.  [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) just
repeated hers when necessary.

* *What's the funding situation like here?* Have you had good luck with 
  grants recently? When you were a new faculty member, 
  did you get much help with grant-writing?  Do you know of senior faculty collaborating with junior faculty, for example? 

* *What's your least favorite part about working here?* 
  Everyone has only great things to say about this place. 

* *What can you tell me about the quality of the graduate students here?*
  How did you go about picking your first few grad students? I've heard
  rumors that a bad grad student can be a significant drain on a new professor---how
  do you avoid that? 
  * *Answer at schools outside the top 15:* 
    > The average graduate student here isn't as
    good as the average graduate student at Berkeley, so you can't always just take
    one from the pool and be assured of getting a winner. However, the best grad
    students here are just as good as the best ones anywhere else---it's just that
    the tail of the distribution is longer. 
  * *Answer at schools from 5-15:* 
   > The students here are great, but we lose our best candidates to Berkeley/MIT/CMU.
  * *Answer at schools in the top 5:* 
   > The students here are stellar.

* *How important is technology transfer or working with the product
  divisions?* What's the funding model here? What happens if I pick something
  to work on and no one in development seems to like it? How do I make 
  contacts with developers? How much academic freedom is there? 

* *What's the tenure process like here?* Can I suggest my own
  letter-writers? Are there mid-point reviews? Is there a "magic formula"?
  How many people have failed to get tenure in the last 10 to 15 years? 
  * *Common Research Academia Answer:* 
    > There's no magic formula. Teaching, research and
    service are all important. Officially, you must excel at 
    two of the three and be adequate in the third. However, you can't 
    really pick research (or
    teaching) as the one to be bad at. Teaching can hurt you---if 
    your teaching evaluations are below a certain threshold, 
    you may fail to get tenure. Otherwise, we largely ignore teaching. 
    The amount of grant money you bring in might be a factor, but we 
    care more about paper and venue quality than quantity. One or two 
    journal papers help. Before going up for tenure, you should teach at 
    least one undergraduate class.

* Friends of mine who are professors at other universities have *had to
  hide their teaching awards when they went up for tenure*. The subtext was
  that if you had that much time to be spending on teaching you should have
  spent it on research. *What are things like here?*

* *What's the teaching load?* Does it change after you get tenure? Can you
  "buy out" of a class? What does that cost? Who decides what you teach? 

* *What's it like being a new single/married faculty member here?* How did
  you make friends when you first came to the area? Was it easy to find
  things to do?

* *Are the faculty young or old?* Is the university structured and
  hierarchical? Do decisions come down from on high? How much power do young
  faculty members have? How much do young faculty shoulder the service/teaching load?

* *What's it like to live here?* How long is your commute? 

* *What's the worst example of office politics you've run into here?* What
  do people fight over?
  * *Common Answer:* 
    > We're very collegial. We don't really have office politics.
    No one gets mad at anyone else. We sometimes squabble over space.

* *What's the general view on (your research area) here?*
  Is it a second-class citizen? Is theory emphasized? Practice? Building big systems? Is the department planning to grow the area beyond this hire? 

**Questions they may ask you:**

You should also be prepared to answer questions that interviewers might 
ask you during these individual meetings. Here are some examples:

* <span class="highlight" style="font-style:italic">Tell me how your interests are aligned with some of the faculty here.
  Who could you work with?</span>
  * This was by far the most common question. We encourage you to write
    down in an obvious place (e.g., at the top of your notebook) the name
    of anyone you think you could collaborate with so that you can answer
    this question intelligently. 

* *Are you married? Do you have a two-body problem?*
  * See below on the [two-body problem](#dual-career-couples).

* *What will your CAREER proposal be about?* 

* *What will your first student's Ph.D. topic be?* How many students do you plan to have? 

* *What courses would you be willing to teach?* Are you interested in
  creating new courses? 

* *How will you divide your time between research, teaching and service?* 

* *Where will you get most of your funding?* The NSF? Other government agencies?
  Corporate funding? 

* <span class="highlight" style="font-style:italic">What sort of research will you be doing in the future?</span> 
  * This is also a very common question.  Nominally your job talk will have
    addressed this, but they may ask again in a more general sense---do you think
    you'll be in (your research area) forever, or do you see yourself
    shifting to (another area)? Take this opportunity to distance yourself from
    your advisor---you want to argue that you can pursue your own work
    for tenure. In [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s experience, the more prestigious the institution, the
    more emphasis they give to this sort of question, sometimes phrased explicitly
    as *"What do you envision your tenure case looking like?"*


**Several of these questions are secretly trying to determine if you know how a 
faculty job works**, especially regarding the aspects to which
graduate students are not always exposed.  For example, *"have you considered
funding sources for your work?"* is mostly an attempt to determine if you have
have any idea how the grant system works.  

[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) typically used up almost all of the time asking questions of the other
person. Remember, you are there to interview them as well.  Moreover, 
there are candidates who can't keep a conversation going after the first
five minutes, which is the kiss of (awkward) death ([Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) heard this from
people interviewing her in several departments). <span class="highlight">You want to convince your
potential colleagues that you are someone they wouldn't mind working 
with or sharing a hallway with. Being able to hold a reasonable 
conversation for 30 minutes is a good start.</span>

From my perspective on the other side, I will echo the above and say, having
some questions/being able to hold a conversation is a genuinely good thing.
_However_, please make sure to let your interviewers get a word in edgewise.  A
candidate who _never_ lets an interviewer ask a question can frustrate a search committee.

I would first note that for any type of interview, having looked up the people
on your schedule and noted at least some work they've done recently goes a long
way in the one-on-one interviews.  Many people seemed genuinely surprised when I
brought up a recent paper and had questions and comments about it.
Additionally, I cannot speak to the types of questions asked in academic job
interviews, but I was somewhat surprised at the number and range of technical
questions asked of me during interviews.  Studying up on common interview topics
(theory and algorithms, mostly) will only benefit you in the regard.

{% capture quote %}
I have two thoughts here:

First, as I applied during COVID-19, it was
easy enough to keep a spreadsheet of topics to talk about with each
interviewer off to the side in another window during my Zoom calls.
I found this totally necessary because I noticed that most of my
interview questions were some variant of "do you have questions for me?"

Secondly, and this may not translate post-COVID, but I encourage saving time in each
interview to ask about life in the city in which the institution is
located.  You can pick up on tips (or red flags) about the city and what
to avoid (e.g., if you are trying to minimize commute time).
