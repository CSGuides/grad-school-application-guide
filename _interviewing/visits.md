# Interview Visit Overview

We’ll cover what you can expect during a typical multi-day interview, 
including the length and structure, different types of meetings 
embedded into the overall interview, and tips for planning and preparation.

<a href="https://www.monperrus.net/martin/">Martin Monperrus</a> notes that this can vary significantly for
European interviews: there is "huge diversity depending on the country and univeristy. Perhaps the only common point is the formal interview (from 45 minutes to 2 hours) in front of a committee (5-10 people)."
This guide discusses an average US interview. 

## Length and Structure of the Interview

A typical interview lasts about one to two days, depending largely on the size of 
the institution. **Larger departments or teams mean more people to meet, which results 
in a longer interview.**

**Arrival and Initial Meeting:** You will arrive near dinner time on the first 
day. Sometimes, someone may meet you at the airport and take you to dinner 
with one or two others, but this varies by institution. After dinner, you'll head to 
your hotel to rest before the main interview day.


**The Main Interview Day:** On the main interview day, your schedule will 
typically include:

* *Breakfast:* Your day will likely start around 8 am.
  Someone might pick you up for breakfast, or you may head 
  directly to the venue. Your first meeting of the day, whether at breakfast or the 
  first interview, is usually with your *host*. This is typically someone currently
  at the intuition who has a similar research area to your own, likes your work, 
  and is responsible for advocating your case to the committee.

* *Your Job Talk:* If you are applying for Research Academia or Industrial 
  Research, you will be asked to give a presentation on your research for 
  45 minutes to an hour. Your job talk might be scheduled early or late in the day. 
  If it is later in the day you will have to include a five 
  minute "elevator" summary of your research at each of your individual
  interviews. If the talk is late and the interview slots are thirty minutes,
  don't expect to get anything done. If the talk is early you can use that
  time to discuss potential collaborations or answer questions they have (and
  they will have them!) about your talk. 

* *Your Teaching Talk:* If you are interviewing for a teaching-focused position,
  you may be asked to give an example undergraduate lecture instead of (or 
  sometimes in addition to) a research-focused job talk. This talk will also
  last 45 minutes to an hour, and can be scheduled any time during the day.

* *Interview Meetings:* Until around 5 pm, the rest of your day will be filled with
  back-to-back interviews, 
  often lasting from 30 to 60 minutes each. You will likely meet with 
  potential colleagues (e.g., faculty or researchers), senior personnel (e.g., a manager,
  department chair, or dean), and current students. It’s completely legitimate to take 
  notes during these interviews; doing so will help you remember the conversations 
  and the people you met.

* *Lunch:* There’s usually a break for lunch at a nice restaurant with two to four others.

* *Dinner:* If you didn't have dinner the day before, you may have dinner with 
  the three to five interviewers. This dinner typically starts around 6 pm,
  and lasts about two hours. After dinner, you’ll return to your hotel to rest.

**Extended Interviews:** For longer interviews (e.g., IBM Research, Georgia Tech, UMass Amherst, 
or large departments in general), the process may continue the next morning until lunch. 
If you’re staying an extra half-day, you can optionally arrange for the department 
to set up a visit with a real-estate agent. **Even if it feels presumptuous, this is 
not awkward or insulting.** Even if they don't extend
you an offer, getting a feel for that area will give you a broader basis for
comparison when you are considering your actual offers.

## The Different Types of Interview Meetings

Almost all of your time will be spent in offices talking to people
individually. These interviews typically last between 30 and 60 minutes. 

**Meetings With Potential Colleagues:** Most of your interviews will be with
potential colleagues (e.g., other faculty or researchers at the institution).
The goal of these meetings is to assess your fit within the department, 
explore potential collaborations, and discuss your research in more detail.  

Below, we provide a [list of questions that
you may consider asking in these meetings](#individual-interview-questions).

**Meeting with the Dean or Department Head:** You will likely have a meeting (or lunch) 
with the dean, department head, or upper-level division manager. This meeting 
tends to differ from your other interviews. *At many institutions, the dean 
will discuss exciting developments and multi-disciplinary centers.* Initially, 
this may well sound irrelevant to you. However, such initiatives can be potential 
sources of collaboration and funding. You may also receive a copy of the 
department's "strategic plan." <!--Other places are of the opinion that you can either spend your time writing strategic plans or you can spend your time doing actual work.-->

Questions to ask the dean might include:

* *Where is the department heading?* Ask the dean to forecast things seven years
  into the future when you'll have tenure. (invariably the department is growing and going up in the 
  rankings unless you're already MIT or McGill, at which point the department is working
  hard to maintain its number-one-in-the-country ranking) 

* *What changes have occurred in the last few years?*

* *What are the future hiring plans?*

* *What is the retirement plan like?* This shows long term interest, and you probably
  don't know anything about them yet as a grad student.


[Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) met with at least three deans who had reviewed her application and had
questions about her research. This was more common when the dean was a computer
scientist.

<!-- Tidbit: as of 2013, the dean at CMU's School of CS still maintains an
active research program (focusing largely on systems).  Their conversation was
quite similar to a standard interview meeting, and Claire has since learned that
the dean in question is absolutely invested in the technical contributions of
anyone to whom the school makes an offer. This was non-typical.-->

**Meeting with the Department Chair (or Local Hiring Manager):** Typically, the last 
interview on your schedule is with the department chair or local hiring manager. 
During this meeting, the chair will likely mention that they are in the middle of 
the interview process and will conclude deliberations in a certain number of days. 
Make sure to get this timeline as firmly as you can, and write it down. 
The chair will also want to know what your
time frame for making decisions is (e.g., when will you be done with
your interviews). Ask why they are hiring. Is it to develop courses? Bring
in students? Do more research? Bring in grant money? Grow the department?  Ask
if they expect to continue to hire in the future, and how much they have hired
in the past.

**Meeting with Students:** When setting up your interview, arrange for a 
meeting with graduate students if it’s not already on the schedule. This 
meeting can be over lunch or in a common meeting room during one of your 
slots. <span class="highlight">Be wary of any institution that won’t let you to meet 
alone with graduate students (or undergrads if you’re at a college).</span>

In these meetings, you might get anywhere from 3-4 students to up to 10-15. 
Larger groups can be more challenging to manage as you will have to 
lead the discussion. 

Sometimes the students will have seen your talk and will have (often very good)
questions.  [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s toughest grilling during her interviews by far was at the
hands of graduate students.  However, much of the time the students will be
young (first or second year) and often won't really have anything to say.

*Occasionally, students will ask tough questions* like:
* "what will you bring to this department that we don't already have?"
* "how does your research influence your teaching?"
* "what courses will you offer when you first arrive?"
* "how will you choose your grad students?". 

You should have answers to all of these -- don't be like [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) and get 
surprised by them in real-time.

You should take time to ask a bunch of questions, such as about
their research, the program requirements, their background, and so on. [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
tried to think of issues that mattered to her as a graduate student and ask
about them, such as if they felt the faculty was responsive to their concerns or
how much their input on this particular meeting mattered in the hiring process.
See below for [more ideas about what you might ask](#individual-meeting-questions).

**Navigating the Interview Dinner:** The interview dinner can be long, 
especially when you’re already tired. You might need to navigate social 
situations, such as deciding whether to drink alcohol, dealing with 
someone dominating the conversation, etc.

We recommend that you plan in advance for potentially stressful social situations.
For example, both [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) and [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) made it a rule to have at most one glass of red wine, 
and only if someone else ordered alcohol first. 

[Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s "silver rule" (after only drinking
if the host is drinking) is "never say anything mean about anyone, especially not your current
institution or other institutions at which you are interviewing". 
She notes that this rule applies even if your current institution is legitimately dysfunctional.

<a href="https://www.monperrus.net/martin/">Martin Monperrus</a> 
elaborates that for European interviews, "the informal dinner/lunch is a classic, and &mdash; cultural difference :) &mdash; it might happen in a good restaurant. My recurring advice to my students is <emph>to train to have a great academic conversation at a restaurant</emph>".

**Following Up:** 
We recommending sending "thank you" emails, at least to your host. We also
recommend following up with schools in which you're interested, especially if you have
deadlines from other schools. 

[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) notes that during an interview you may receive
invitations from individual faculty to move toward collaboration on a future or paper or grant proposal. 
If you do not receive an offer from that school, it is understood that those 
invitations to feel out a collaboration are entirely optional. There are many good people at many good institutions
you might work with, and there is no expectation that you form a working relationship with
each one. Phrased another way, being nice to people and looking for potential collaborations does
not hurt you (instead, it helps you). 

## Personal Considerations

**Dress Comfortably:** It really doesn't matter what you wear, 
so wear what makes you the most
comfortable.  No one will remember if you wore coordinated separates
instead of a full suit.  They might remember if you were obviously
uncomfortable in your clothes or if you couldn't walk because of your
shoes.  If you are comfortable in a suit and have one that fits you and you
want to wear it, go ahead.  If you are purchasing your first suit since
high school to interview, abort.  [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), and [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) pulled their
interview outfits from their existing wardrobes. If you do want to wear a
suit of some kind, practice giving talks and sitting around in it before
your interviews.

**Prepare for Exhaustion:** <span class="highlight">It is basically 
impossible to communicate in advance how tiring the
interview process is</span>, especially since interview season is also prime
get-stuck-because-of-snow season. Flying every other day (especially from coast
to coast) is exhausting (East Coasters have a real advantage in terms of jet
lag). With time zone shifts you'll never really be able to
get a good meal in transit (except for the ones they take you to), so pack
some snacks! 

Beyond transit, being "on" for a day and a half can be
extremely draining. Aside from these interviews it's rare to spend nine hours (!)
consecutively talking to people about complicated topics, knowing that your
future employment is on the line. You must smile and be friendly and in a good
humor the whole time. It's not difficult, but it does take more energy than you
think. Talking to professors you don't know for a nine hours is not like talking
to your friends for nine hours. [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) always travels with ear plugs, an eye mask, 
melatonin, and a kindle/book to help sleep,
as well as a bathing suit and workout clothing to take advantage of hotel gyms
when available.  Take care of yourself physically.  You do yourself no
favors if you are so tired and strung out that your are no longer at your mental
best.

Make sure you drink lots of water!!

(As a fun aside, every single in-person interview gave me some sort of branded water bottle.
Several of them were actually quite nice :) )

Having applied during COVID-19, all my interviews were fully remote.
Some institutions did one long day of interviews, others spread it over
multiple days.  Given the flexibility, some institutions even did three
or four half-days.  It was also easy enough to not think about wardrobe
(I may have worn sweat pants to more than one tenure-track faculty
interview). 

My advice is, if you have a remote interview, make sure to have
at least one physical visit at some point.  Since you are making a decision
about a significant portion of your life (tenure-track may potentially
be a lifetime decision), you owe it to yourself to see if you even like
the location.  In addition, set aside time in your interviews to ask
each person about the city, what to do, and what to avoid.  I picked up
tips about traffic (commute time is important to me) and other aspects
of living in the city of each institution.

Whether your interview is in-person or you visit physically at some
other time, also take time to learn about things aside from your
institution.  The tired canard "they're not just interviewing you,
you're interviewing them" applies.  It will be an additional burden, but
spend time thinking about whether you would be happy living in that
city.
