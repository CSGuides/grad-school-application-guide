# Phone Screening

In our experience, about half of institutions will reach out for a phone 
screening before inviting you to an in-person interview.

Most institutions will give you a list of
everyone who will be on the call a few days before the interview. This will
typically include a couple members of the hiring committee.
**If the institution doesn't let you know who is on the call, it is totally
legitimate to email and ask.** Knowing who will be on the call is 
important because it allows you to look up their publications and 
committee appointments.  This can help you formulate thoughtful questions and 
demonstrate your interest in the school. For example, if you see
that one of your interviewers is a member of a center you're interested in,
you can ask:

> "I was looking through your website, and I noticed that you are a member
  of **Center X. I am interested in this center because Y**. What has your
  experience been with...."

**We recommend that you have several questions prepared before the interview.**
[Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) found it helpful to write her questions on a notepad on her computer,
so that she could refer to them if needed.

In our experience, screenings typically last 20-40 minutes, and are conducted
via video conferencing. You will often start by introducing
yourself and your research (some institutions may ask you to
prepare slides). Then, for the next 10-15 minutes, your interviewers
will ask you questions about your career goals and research. Finally, the last
5-10 minutes are typically reserved for any questions that you have for the interviewers.

Perhaps counterintuitively, the goal of a phone screening isn't always just to see 
if your research is above bar. *If you've made it to the screening stage, the committee
already likes your application!*  Instead, the goal is to determine how well 
you can articulate your research in a social setting and assess 
whether you would be a good fit for the department. 
<span class="highlight">When a university or a research lab hires a colleague, they
are hiring someone that they might work with for decades; they want to ensure 
the person is a good fit for their team and culture.</span>

Phone screenings are also used by institutions to gauge your genuine 
interest in the position and whether you would likely accept an offer if given. 
This is especially the case for smaller 
institutions that can only afford a limited
number of in-person interviews or that are in less desirable locations that may struggle
to attract new hires. **Before your screening, do your research!** Make sure you know
basic information about the location, and have answers prepared regarding what
excites you about the area and why you applied. You might be surprised
how many candidates fail the interview at this stage. For example, [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) was told 
that a candidate at UMass Amherst had not passed to the next round
because they indicated that they were excited about living in Boston 
(Amherst is two hours west of Boston and is a small town with 30,000 people).

Out of the six schools that I heard back from in some form, four of them
invited me to a phone screening. For the other two, I was invited directly 
to an in-person interview.

All of my screening interviews were conducted over Zoom, and they were
mostly with two or three members of the hiring committee. The one exception
was my phone screening with Purdue, which included the full hiring committee 
on the call. I generally preferred the smaller phone screenings, as I had
fun talking to each interviewer more directly. However, it's good
to be prepared for either format.
