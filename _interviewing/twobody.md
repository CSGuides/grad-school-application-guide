# Dual-Career Couples

*In this section, we talk about strategies for dual-career couples, and if
you should disclose your partnered status.* 
The advice in this section applies to both regular dual-career couples and those
facing the actual *academic two-body problem*.

For context, [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) and 
[Kevin Angstadt](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
were single when they were on the market; [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) 
and [Hammad](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) 
had partners who were
planning to move with them and find a job in the software industry; [Kevin Leach](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
and Yu were partners seeking academic positions together in
the same department (the traditional two-body problem); 
[Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) had a partner who wanted to be in a location where
they could pursue their career in the arts.  [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), [Kevin Leach](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), and [Yu](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
mentioned their relationship statuses in their cover letters; 
[Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) 
and 
[Hammad](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
did not. 

You may be asked about your marital or relationship status during your
interviews, though [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) never was, and believes that interviewers have become more attuned to this issue in general (especially with candidates who present as female).  Regardless,
the question is illegal.

Everyone will want to know.  I put it at the top of my CV and I am
fairly sure my marital status was mentioned in at least one of my
letters.  We did not want any confusion over what we wanted together.  

The risk I see with revealing this status is that you will have
institutions reject you outright because they simply cannot hire two
people at once.   In that regard, it may give one body less negotiating
power later with institutions that do make offers together.  *However*,
I believe the flip side is that institutions interested in helping you
resolve your dual-career issue will be receptive if you mention it
outright (e.g., they will move more quickly if one body has a deadline).  
It also made other discussions easier later (scheduling
interviews, and negotiating salary and startup).

*Everyone may ask anyway* (even if you have put the answer
explicitly on the front of your resume). Just deal with it. I have at least two
data points of people being put in very awkward positions here (one was loosely
"we have a lot of great women on campus and if you can't find someone within a
few years there's something wrong with you" and the other was loosely "what's
you religion and sexual orientation?"). Have a nice way to back out of such
conversational cul-de-sacs. If you are asked anything more intrusive than "are
you married?"  feel free to mention it to your host. It's better to point this
out to someone who likes you than to have the evil questioner's possibly
negative opinion of you hurt your chances.

*Everyone really wants to know and you should
almost certainly tell them.*  During my interviews, I would
find a way to drop my partner's existence and job ambitions into an early
conversation. *In every case*, I was met with a relieved "Oh I'm so glad
you told me that because we really want to know and we can't ask."  I strongly
encourage you to be open and honest about any two-body or dual-career situation
you may have.  The sooner a department knows about your partner's job needs, the
more likely it is that they can find something for your partner in time to
convince you that accepting the position is beneficial for you and your family.
There is a school of thought that one should wait until one knows a department
is interested before divulging a two-body situation.  However, I have seen this
backfire for other couples more than once, at multiple places, in that by the time an offer is on
the table, it is too late to arrange for an interview with another department.
This is obviously a bigger problem if your partner is also in academia.

I freely admit that I am lucky in that my spouse has made very portable career
choices.  That said, I was extremely upfront about my partner and his job
aspirations, and departments that made me offers simultaneously made connections
for him at local companies.  He even did some onsite interviews during second
visits.

The interview process is a giant two-party courtship exercise in which the
interviewee is trying to convince the department to make a job offer, and the
interviewer is trying to convince the interviewee that the department/location
is the ideal place to live/work.  As such, a legitimate department at which you
want to work should fall over backwards to convince you that they can get your
spouse/partner a job.  Anecdotal example: The dean at UIUC opened his meeting
with me by saying "I am not interested in your family circumstances, and it
would be inappropriate and illegal for me to ask you about them.  However, I
would like to share with you unprompted all of UIUC's policies regarding
dual-career couples..."

Look at it this way: The only reason not to be up front about this issue is that
you are worried that doing so will hurt your job prospects.  However, if a
department (illegally) decides not to hire you because your spouse needs a job,
you probably would not have gone there anyway, because
*your spouse would not have had a job in time for the decision to be
reasonable.* Moreover, and I freely admit that this statement arises from my
privileged position of working in an academic field that is, by and large,
hiring: I personally do not want to work with people who will not hire me
because I am in a romantic partnership or because I have or may one day have
family obligations. If anyone decided not to interview me or offer me a
position for these reasons, they would have saved me the trouble of having to
uncover their misogyny some other way.

I pre-filtered the schools that I applied to based on location constraints for
both me and my partner (a classical music composer). However, some locations
were still better on paper than others.

As a result, I also tried to drop my partner into conversations at schools. 
When I mentioned that he was a composer, 
interviewers at every school offered to put me in contact with
local musical contacts. From these connections, my partner and I were able to better
understanding of the musical environment around each school.

*If you are planning to relocate with a partner, I highly recommend that you ask
about opportunities and support during your interview.*

On the topic of being honest about things and covering somewhat personal topics,
I feel as though I should mention that coming across like a real person is
helpful in a heavily technical field like ours.  While I may be biased, as I
felt like I came from a somewhat less-strong technical foundation, I found that
people genuinely appreciated me trying to make idle conversation and be
personable.  There are plenty of tips in, for instance, the business world about
being personable, but I think people in all industries look for potential
employees that they think they could work with every day on a personal level.

One final note on partners and jobs: emigrating to Canada with a partner appears
to be pretty trivial, based on [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s (serious) conversations with Waterloo on
the subject.  The Canadian immigration system remains straightforward, at least compared to
the US, and their HR departments are practiced in
providing support for the process.

Now that you've finished your interviews, it's time to [make a decision](/grad-job-guide/deciding)
and accept an offer.
