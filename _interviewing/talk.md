# Preparing Your Job Talk

If you are applying for Research Academia or Industrial Research positions, 
you will likely be asked to give a presentation on your research for 
around 50 minutes.

**Structuring Your Job Talk:** The general structure and content of a job 
talk can be easily found through a quick Google search 
(e.g., "academic job talk, computer science, structure").

If you are lucky enough to be at a department that hires
regularly, attend all the talks in the year before you go on the market, 
*especially* the ones outside your field.
Take notes on how much introductory material, related work, detailed material,
and future work are presented. Then, forget about it for nine months until you
have to craft your own. In general, your job talk will discuss two to three
papers that you worked on in grad school, connected into an overall narrative.
You'll also want to include a future work section.

Although the average time is "fifty minutes for the talk and ten minutes for
questions", different places will have different time requirements. At one stop,
[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) was asked to fit the entire thing into 50 minutes. At another, he had 75
minutes. [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) found a similar spread.  Prepare your talk in a modular manner
so that you can add or remove sections. Bonus points if you can do
this on the fly---frequent interruptions are common and can consume a lot 
of time.  Try to avoid giving lengthy answers to questions posed in the middle
of your talk (answer the question, but be succinct).  At one venue, [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) actually
had audio-visual difficulties that delayed (and 
thus shortened) his talk by ten minutes (!).  [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) recommends traveling with your
own laptop and VGA/HDMI/USB-C adapter to defend against such hassles.  The exception is the
FFRDCs (like Lincoln Labs), where defense department rules will require you to
email your slides as PDFs ahead of time.

[Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) changed her talk modestly between interviews.  Moving things around a bit
between presentations helped keep the talk fresh.  After you've done it a few
times, the jokes become very unfunny to you. Do what you can to avoid boring
yourself.

**Being able to adjust your timing on the fly during your job talk is really helpful**.

My talk was divided into three main sections, and I paused briefly for 
questions after each one. The number of questions varied between schools, 
so having a "short version" and a "long version" of a couple of slides 
helped me always finish my talk on time.

Additionally, most schools will give you about 30 minutes before the 
talk to check the audio-visual setup. **I recommend that you try and 
arrive at the room early during this time. It's better to be ready ahead 
of schedule than to risk running late.** I brought my own laptop and 
adapter to all my interviews. However, the setup varied from school 
to school due to different recording systems. For example, some 
schools asked me to share my screen via Zoom, while others used an 
integrated room system. At one school, it took almost 25 minutes to 
get everything working.

**Practice, Practice, Practice!** Make sure that you schedule a practice 
job talk of some sort, even if only with your
local research group. Everyone there will be able to give you advice on it. Make
sure that people who are not in your field or office come to your practice
talk. During your actual job talks, at most one or two other people
will be from your field. The rest of the room will be made up of people from
other domains within computer science.  Besides, the people in your subfield are
probably the reason you're being interviewed; people outside your subfield need
to be convinced. The exception to this is industry. In large industrial
research labs, you will basically only present to people in your
general area.

If possible, also try to do a dry run at a school to which you're not applying. For example, [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) gave a colloquium talk at Virginia Tech about three months before
submitting her applications.  It wasn't nearly so intense as a real interview, and it was nice to practice the talk with an unfamiliar audience before doing it for real.

**The "One-Third Rule":** A common piece of advice suggests that one-third of your talk should
be understood by everyone in the room, one-third should be understood by
people in your general area (e.g., graphics, programming languages,
systems) and one-third should be understood "only by you". However, this advice is
a bit controversial.

The trick here is that your job talk must serve many purposes. It must
convince them that you are a good lecturer (i.e., the talk must be engaging
and speak to your teaching abilities). It will also be their first exposure
to your work (as above, many people will be reading you resume at the
beginning of your interview -- unless you're at a small department, don't
expect anyone beyond your host to know anything about you or your work
unless you say it to them) and must help to convince them that your
research has substance. This point is actually somewhat tricky, because if
they asked you for an interview they probably already believe your work is
good enough (based on you resume, letters, and the local evaluation of the
department members closest to your subfield). 

<span class="highlight" style="font-style:italic">It is our *personal opinion* 
that basically the entire talk should be understandable to everyone in the room.</span>
Motivation is key. Remind people of why your research area is worth considering. 
As a random example, a tenured AI professor 
may well think that "compilers are a solved problem". It won't hurt
to remind such a person that your work is exciting.  [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
often used the phrase:
> "This is really exciting because..." 

to help her audience roadmap key contributions. Keeping everyone interested will help to convince
them of you teaching potential. In addition, if people cannot understand your
talk they have no way to spot potential collaborations. 

Most of us designed our job talks to be easily understood by everyone (heavy on motivation, context,
analogies and pictures). [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), and [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) all received comments about
how understandable they were, and we also got quite a few offers for
collaboration based on them (e.g., graphics and database people were able to see
possible fits, not just PL/SE people). The exception here is for industrial research 
(e.g., Microsoft, IBM): if your audience is be more closely aligned to your research 
area, you can
sometimes skimp on motivation.  However, including it anyways
probably won't count against you (because they explicitly mention that they
realize that no one prepares two job talks, and that they know that the intro is appropriate in
academia) but you can possibly earn bonus points by tailoring your talk to those
audiences.

[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) specifically asked people after his
talk if the lack of "Greek letters" or "complicated-looking material" hurt his
case. Typical responses included *"it wasn't a problem because were able to see
how intelligently you handled yourself when answering the questions"* or *"it was
fine because we already know how good your work is"* or *"no, not at all."*
However, [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) was advised of the 1/3-1/3-1/3 rule many times throughout her
job search. Thus we cannot give you a blanket guarantee that following our
approach won't hurt your employability. **We were willing to take that risk to
stand up for something we believed in. We encourage you to consider it
carefully.**  

# Preparing Your Teaching Talk

If you are interviewing for a teaching-focused position, you will likely 
be asked to give an example undergraduate lecture instead of (or sometimes in addition to) a research-focused job talk.

Unlike with a Research Job Talk, the topic and time limit of a teaching talk
can vary widely between schools. Some might ask for a lecture on a specific
topic, while others leave it up to you. You may not be able to use the
same lecture topic at all of your interviews.

While most common for teaching-focused positions, even for a research faculty position, 
some schools will ask you to 
prepare either a short commentary on your teaching style (in 2013, Iowa State
requested 10 minutes of the job talk be dedicated to teaching), or an actual
teaching demo (Waterloo requested a 20-30 minute example lecture, given
separately from the job talk).  [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) advises you to not skimp on
teaching demo preparation.  It can make a big difference in helping you stand
out from the crowd, the rest of which probably did skimp.

I found the research talks to be fairly standard, but the teaching-track
talks were all unique and required significantly more prep.  Some
institutions required a talk about a pre-selected topic.  Others let you
pick your own.  One required submitting a recording.   All of them had
different timing requirements (from 25 minutes to 90 minutes).  Some had students present.  
Some schools wanted active learning, others wanted standard slides. 
As a result, it was more difficult to incorporate everyone's feedback.
Part of this may have been reaction to the pandemic, but
I tend to believe teaching-track faculty talks are more
difficult to prepare for than tenure-track research talks.
