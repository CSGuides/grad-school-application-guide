# Visit Days: You Interview a Grad School

If you receive an offer, you may be invited to an **in-person or virtual visit day**. Most U.S. PhD programs cover your expenses.  
Attend these if you can — they’re invaluable for comparing fit across schools.

Missing class for visit days should be considered an excused absence—your advisors can advocate for you." user="kevin" %}

### What to Expect

Visit days often include:

- Meetings with potential advisors and students  
- Department presentations  
- Social or community events

Talking to current students gives you the clearest sense of **advisor fit** and **department culture**.

### Inverted Question Strategy

Because departments are trying to recruit you, answers may sound overly positive.  
You can phrase questions to get more realistic information—for example:

- Instead of: “Is it easy to switch advisors?”  
  Ask: “Do you know anyone who has switched advisors? How did that go?”  
- Instead of: “Is there a reporting process for misconduct?”  
  Ask: “Do you know anyone who’s used that process? What was it like?”

The goal is to learn from how people respond—not just what they say.

# Making Decisions

In the U.S., graduate schools coordinate deadlines around **April 15th**.  
You can (and should) wait to make decisions until you have all offers in hand.

When comparing offers, consider both objective and personal factors:  
advisor fit, research interest alignment, stipend, location, ranking, morale, and department climate.

{% include quote.html content="Students often make decisions based on non-ranking factors. A student at a lower-ranked school can thrive under the right advisor, just as a top-ranked program can be miserable if it’s not a fit." user="weimer" %}

{% include quote.html content="All other things being equal, I encourage students to prioritize themselves rather than rankings, especially for PhD programs. It’s an endurance race—comfort, community, and location all matter." user="kevin" %}

Finally, be aware of **exploding industry offers**—companies may pressure you to decide before April 15th.  
While they might say you’ll have to “reapply,” strong candidates are almost always re-hired quickly in the next cycle.
