# Visit Days: You Interview a Grad School

If you receive an offer, you may be invited to an **in-person or virtual visit day**. Most U.S. PhD programs cover your expenses.  
Attend these if you can — they’re invaluable for comparing fit across schools.

Missing class for visit days should be considered an excused absence—your advisors can advocate for you." user="kevin" %}

### What to Expect

Visit days often include:

- Meetings with potential advisors and students  
- Department presentations  
- Social or community events

Talking to current students gives you the clearest sense of **advisor fit** and **department culture**.

### Inverted Question Strategy

Because departments are trying to recruit you, answers may sound overly positive.  
You can phrase questions to get more realistic information—for example:

- Instead of: “Is it easy to switch advisors?”  
  Ask: “Do you know anyone who has switched advisors? How did that go?”  
- Instead of: “Is there a reporting process for misconduct?”  
  Ask: “Do you know anyone who’s used that process? What was it like?”

The goal is to learn from how people respond—not just what they say.
