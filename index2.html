<h3>Introduction</h3>

This document summarizes experience, opinions, and advice (and advice received
from others) on looking for jobs in academia and industrial research labs in the
field of computer science. It contains both general advice and information on
three particular job searches: Wes's search for a programming languages / software
engineering position in the Spring of 2005, Claire's search for the same in
Spring of 2013, and Zak's search for industrial research positions in 2014. 
It is structured as a how-to guide for graduate students.  When
editorializing more than usual, we have noted who is "speaking" both by
bolding names and by
color-coding. <font color="#990033">Wes is reddish</font>, 
<font color="#0099FF">Claire is blueish</font>, and 
<font color="#008000">Zak is greenish</font>.

Many wise and wonderful people were kind enough to grant Wes the boon of
their wisdom on this subject. They include, but are not limited to: 
<font size=-2>
<ul>
<li>Alex Aiken (Stanford) 
<li>Ras Bodik (Berkeley) 
<li>Katherine Compton (Wisconsin) 
<li>Richard Fateman (Berkeley) 
<li>Jill Findeis (PSU) 
<li>Stephen Freund (Williams) 
<li>Patrice Godefroid (Bell Labs)
<li>Sumit Gulwani (Microsoft)
<li>Tom Henzinger (EPFL) 
<li>Ranjit Jhala (UCSD) 
<li>Iain Keddie (IBM) 
<li>Jim Larus (Microsoft) 
<li>David Liben-Nowell (Carleton)
<li>Tessa Lau (IBM) 
<li>Rupak Majumdar (UCLA) 
<li>Wayne McMullen (PSU)
<li>Greg Morrisett (Harvard) 
<li>George Necula (Berkeley) 
<li>Jens Palsberg (UCLA) 
<li>Sriram Rajamani (Microsoft) 
<li>David Shoenthal (Longwood)
<li>Raj Varma (Delaware)
<li>Mark Wegman (IBM) 
<li>Donna Weimer (Juniata)
</ul>
</font>

Claire did not consult many people for her contributions to this document, as
she modified it after it had long been written.  However, beyond Wes, she would
particularly like to acknowledge the support and assistance of:
<font size=-2>
<ul>
<li>Katie Stolee (Iowa State)
<li>Yuriy Brun (UMass-Amherst)
<li>Reid Holmes (Waterloo)
<li>Ivan Beschastnikh (UBC)
<li>Stephanie Forrest (UNM)
<li>John Knight (UVA)
</ul>
</font>
... and the many others who offered advice and support throughout her own
job search.
<p>
You may safely assume that all of the good ideas here come from them and
that all bad advice comes from us.  

<p>Zak had a similarly short list of consultations, as he targeted exclusively 
industrial research positions and arguably had a more "homogeneous" job search 
experience overall:
<font size=-2>
<ul>
<li>Wes Weimer (UVA)
<li>Lori Pollock (UD)
<li>Stephanie Forrest (UNM)
<li>John Knight (UVA)
<li>Pieter Hooimeijer (Facebook)
<li>Ray Buse (Google)
<li>Joel Coffman (Johns Hopkins APL)
</ul>
</font>

<p>
This guide includes some publicly-available application materials for comparison
and convenience. You could get them off of archive.org yourself if you so
desired.

<A name="letters"><h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3></a>

You will need four letters of recommendation, one of which will come from
your advisor. The typical dilemma here involves finding the other three. 
You may well have only published papers with your advisor and the
supervisor from you summer internship. Where do you find two others? 
<p>
Start now! Email some of the other professors in your department and make
appointments to talk to them about your research and your plans. Ask them
if they have any ideas, talk about possible collaborations, convince them
to critique drafts of your papers, whatever. The more they know you the
better and you may even get research ideas out of it. 
<p>
If you plan to do your job search interviews in the Spring of Year X, talk
to your advisor about who should write your letters in the Summer of Year
X-1 (or earlier!) and then ask them by the end of that summer. Give them
plenty of warning. 
<p>
<b>Wes: </b><font color ="#990033">
At the end of the day, I can only offer myself as a data point for
what was "good enough". I had never written a paper with Alex Aiken but I
had corresponded with him since the end of my undergraduate days. We had
similar research interests, I almost ended up as his advisee, we got along
well at research group lunches, I went to his office more than once to talk
about research and ideas, and he invited me to Stanford to give a practice
talk. I had written a paper with Tom Henzinger, sat in on one of his
classes, and visited his office once or twice to talk about things and ask
for advice. I had never written a paper with Jim Larus but he supervised my
internship at Microsoft Research and was familiar with my research work. 
Left to my own devices, I would have chosen Sriram Rajamani (also from my
internship) instead of Jim since he knew me better personally, but it was
suggested that Jim's more senior position and experience in both industry
and academia would lead to a more useful reference. Talk to your advisors. 
</font>

<p><b>Claire:</b> <font color="#0099FF">Wes's advice about letter writers basically guided my
selection thereof: Wes was my adviser; Stephanie Forrest and I have worked and
written papers together for many years; I have taken classes, written at least
one paper, and supported grants with John Knight throughout my graduate career;
and Mark Harman and I have been in contact about my work since before I received
my Masters.  I was told by at least one department chair that the strength of my
letters was critically important to securing the interview(s) in question.  I
encourage you to select your letter writers carefully.</font>

<p><b>Zak:</b> <font color="#008000"> The jobs I applied for required a maximum of three letters and I was fortunate enough to get letters from a subset of Claire&#39;s letter writers: Wes Weimer (primary advisor), Stephanie Forrest (mentor and co-author on three papers), and John Knight (with whom I took a class and often solicited advice from throughout my grad career).  To highlight a potential pitfall, I will note that one of my undergraduate advisors (with whom I was co-author on several papers) agreed to write me a letter of recommendation, but noted that it might be somewhat weak because of the time that had lapsed since our professional interaction.  Wes&#39;s sage advice was that anyone who flat-out admits that they may not be able to write you the strongest recommendation letter should be used as a last resort.  While I very much appreciate the generosity and honesty of my previous advisor, I am glad that I eventually chose someone with a more comprehensive knowledge of my most recent work.</font>

<a name="general"><h3>Where To Apply In General</h3></a>

If you plan to be doing your job search interviews in the Spring of Year X
you must submit applications in the Fall of Year X-1 (or by January 15-ish
of Year X). You must decide where you will be applying early because
different categories of institutions have different deadlines. 
<p>
Despite the canonical "industry versus academia" phrasing, there are
actually a number of choices:
<ul>
<li> <b>Research Academia</b>. This includes "top-ten" schools like MIT,
CMU, Berkeley, Stanford, and Cornell as well schools with lower rankings
like UC Irvine, Purdue, Rutgers and Virginia. This is the default type of
application. Your applications will be due around December or January. 

<li> <B>Industrial Research Labs</b>. This includes Microsoft Research, IBM
Research (T.J. Watson), Intel Labs, GrammaTech, Bell Labs, Sun Labs, NEC,
BBN Raytheon, Google, and so on.  Industry tends to feature "rolling
interviews" (they aren't on Academia's semester clock) but they will do
most of their interviewing for this type of position at the same time as
academia will.  We group Federally Funded Research and Development Centers
(FFRDCs) like Lincoln Labs and MITRE in this category. 

<li> <b>Industrial "Startups"</b>. This includes Ph.D.-seeking high-tech
companies in your particular area or recently-formed startups. Examples
include Coverity, Green Hills, Fortify and EMC. These also generally follow
Industry's looser time clock. We have no personal experience with this type
of work, but others suggest that it typically involves taking a research
idea much further than you would in academia. Over the course of years you
take a good idea from concept to product with all of the steps along the
way (e.g., documentation, testing, shipping, marketing). Advice we've
received suggests that this is actually very rewarding and that "right out
of school" is a not a bad time to try it. 

<li> <b>Non-US US-Like Research Academia</b>. This includes McGill, Toronto,
Waterloo, and UBC in Canada; EPFL in Switzerland; University College London
in the UK; and lesser-known places like
John Cabot University in Italy.  These schools are located outside of the US
but follow many US practices with respect to tenure and research and conduct
classes in English. This is basically just like a job at a US university. 
<p>
The trick here is that they tend not to take US applicants seriously. US
applicants typically tend (for whatever reason -- picking the known over the
unknown, staying close to family, trying to use such places as safety schools,
etc.) not to accept jobs at such places even when they are offered.  
You should only apply for such positions if you're serious about them (we both
were). You're making it harder for everyone else otherwise.
<p>
We recommend including an explicit notice in your cover letter and research
statement detailing (in a few sentences) why you really want to go there and why
they should take you seriously (e.g., you speak the local language, you have family
there, you are not tied to the US, whatever).  You can also emphasize these
facts on the phone and in person.  For example, Claire is of Francophone descent
and speaks French fluently, facts that are relevant in Canada even outside
Quebec.  If you are granted an interview, be able to recall at minimum the name
of the current prime minister and all of the provinces (states, departments,
whatever) of the country in question.
<p>
If you are offered an interview or a position at such an institution, ask about
immigration and the kind of help they'll provide you and your spouse in crossing
borders.  Such schools have experience with these issues and can be quite
helpful.  It is also legitimate to ask about differences between academic
systems.  For example, salaries in Canada are 12-month, not 9; tenure is decided
at 5 years, not 6; and the funding system is almost entirely different as
compared to the States.
<p>
One more word on applying to Canada: Canadian CS and ECE departments are
typically interchangeable for the purposes of an SE applicant, and thus you should apply
to both.  Evidently there is considerable variation in terms of how well the two
departments get along at different schools. All schools will tell you that they
get along capitally, especially as compared to all other schools, which are
plagued by infighting and competition.  

<li> <b>Non-US Research Academia</b>. This includes places like ENS in
France, Oxford in the UK and Tsinghua in China. These places may not
conduct classes in English, usually have a different promotion and tenure
scheme, and often have different requirements (e.g., they may expect a
post-doc or a second degree and they are rumored to tend to hire "locally").
We can't help you here, and in general if you don't already know much more
about this corner of the world than we do you shouldn't count on ending up
at one of these places.  The one piece of insight we can add is that in the UK
in particular, a post-doc is effectively mandatory.

<li> <B>Top-Tier Teaching Academia</b>. This includes places like Carleton,
Williams, Wesleyan, Oberlin and Brown. Faculty here still conduct research
but undergraduate education is emphasized and the graduate program (and
thus graduate students) will be smaller or non-existent. (As an aside, a
<i>university</i> has a graduate program and a <i>college</i> does not.) 
Teaching at least 3 courses per year is common. The interview schedule for
such schools is typically one to two months ahead of the schedule for
Research Academia. Your application and letters of recommendation will be
due weeks in advance as well. Thus if you plan on applying to such a school
you must have all of your references ready early. 

<li> <B>Teaching Academia</b>. This includes standard small liberal arts
universities that you probably haven't heard of unless you're from the
locale. Shippensburg, Lock Haven, Haverford, Juniata and Ithaca College are
all good examples. Here the emphasis will be on undergraduate education,
undergraduate advising and scholarship (to the possible exclusion of the
constantly-publishing-papers type of research). Teaching 6 courses a year
is common. In addition, the salary will probably be around half of what you
would receive from the Research Academia category. 

<li> <b>"Instructor" Positions</b>. Most top-tier schools (Berkeley and 
Virginia are both examples) have full-time "instructor" positions. These
positions may or may not be tenure-track (and often are not). They often
have a "social tenure" or "formal expectation of continued employment" at
around the six-year mark that mimics tenure. They tend to
cover teaching undergraduate "service" courses (freeing up the research
faculty to do other things). In such a position you typically have no
research requirements but a high teaching requirement of CS100-ish classes.
If you are interested in one you must seek advice elsewhere (e.g.,
with the instructors or CS education faculty at your university).  

<!-- Wes originally said: It's my personal impression that these positions tend
to open up fairly rarely. Claire asks: I think this depends on what you mean by
"full time instructor" position - calls for one-year instructor, lecturer, or
VAP professors are posted at a very constant rate.  I think you and I might be
thinking about two different types of positions that coincidentally have similar
names?  In any case, you can add the sentence back in if you want, I just found
it confusing so I thought I'd call it out. -->

<li> <B>Standard Industry</b>. If you want to get a job as a normal
Microsoft Developer, your Ph.D. certainly qualifies you. You don't need
this document in that case. Typically grad students aren't interested in
standard dev jobs, but it might be handy to remember that they're out there
if you're jousting with a two-body problem. There is something to be said
for having your work "end" when you go home for the evening or the weekend. 

<li> <b>Post-Docs</b>. Post-docs remain somewhat rare in Computer Science (at
least in our neck of the woods, that is, Not Theory). Traditionally, European
grad students apply for post-docs in the US and then apply for another job
later.  They have become more common in the US since 2008, as a number of
schools froze hiring post-financial crisis.  The low job supply forced otherwise
qualified candidates to take post-docs and try again later.  It then became more
difficult for fresh PhDs to compete with such buffed CVs. That said, it is
still possible (as of 2013) to acquire a tenure-track faculty position in SE or
Systems without a completing a post-doc first.  Post-doc positions typically use
the same calendar as Research Academia, possibly offset slightly and with less
strict deadlines (many people conduct a faculty search first before looking for
a post-doc position).  Taking a post-doc gives you time to flesh out your resume
with additional publications. On the other hand, if you have taken a post-doc
people will expect you resume to be flush with publications. The typical advice
is that if you can possibly get a job without getting a post-doc, just get the
job.
</ul>

Having enumerated all of those possible options, we will now conveniently
forget all of them except research academia and industrial research labs.
<p>
Ultimately you must decide what sort of positions you will apply for on
your own. A research position is not inherently "better" or "worse" than a
teaching position -- they are made up of different things. Find out what
makes you happy. 

<a name="particular"><h3>Where To Apply In Particular</h3></a>

Now that you know the sorts of jobs you're looking for you still have to find
actual jobs to apply for. Here are some approaches:
<ul>
<li> <b>Word of Mouth</b>. If you mention that you'll be on the job market,
people at conferences will tell you if their department is hiring.  They may
even offer to shepherd your application and make sure that it doesn't get lost
(since you're at the same conference they probably like you and the sort of work
you do, so this isn't all that uncommon). You can expect two or three of these
from a big conference. They're not required, but can be extremely helpful.
Claire gave two conference talks in the six months before applying for jobs and
found this approach extremely useful.  She did not end those talks with "I am on
the job market," but should have in hindsight.

<li> <b>ACM, CRA, and IEEE</b>. The ACM, CRA, and IEEE Higher Ed all keep
databases of CS jobs that you can search through.  They have mailing lists that
can send you daily or weekly postings of the most recent job ads.  The blurbs
there can be hard to follow, and are not always consistent with either one
another or what is posted on department websites.  We recommend that you get the
names of places that are hiring from these databases and then go to the
department websites (or whatnot) to double-check the details.

<li> <b>Rankings + Google</b>. Get a list of department rankings. The two most
popular are from US News & World Report and the CRA Taulbee Survey. Go to the
department website of every school in the top N and see if they are advertising
an opening. Note that they probably won't have the advertisement up until the
middle of the Fall Semester.  Claire took the top 100 schools on one such list
and put them in a spreadsheet, with a separate section for Canadian schools.
She updated the spreadsheet when a school on the list posted a job to one of the
above-mentioned websites.  Before applying, she reviewed the schools that were
hiring and filtered according to various preferences. She aimed to apply to
approximately an equal number of schools ranked above and below her graduate
institution (UVA).<br>

If you choose to take a similar approach, Claire recommends modifying your
starting list and filtering criteria as appropriate.  Not everyone wants to work
at a top-ranked school, so don't feel like "top 100" is the only way to go.  For
example, Claire aimed to apply mostly to larger departments.  You are likely to
have different preferences.

<li><b>Ask Around</b>. Your advisor may forward job offers to you. Ask your
recently-graduated friends if they know anyone who is hiring.
</ul>

<p>In 2005, Wes applied to 21 places and got 8 interviews and 5 job offers. In
2013, Claire applied to 28 schools and 1 research lab, got 10 invitations to
interview, went on 9 interviews, and received 8 offers.  Rumor has it that
getting interviews at 33% of your places is average and that the best person in
a particular field-year will get around 50%. A very strong candidate in Wes's
field-year (in his opinion the strongest candidate) applied to 30 places, got 17
interview offers, went on 15 interviews and got 7 job offers.

<p>When considering these data points, note that Spring 2005 was considered to
have "strong competition" and "many strong applicants" in PL/SE (almost
everywhere Wes interviewed remarked on it).  Claire's current impression is that
2013 was a candidate's market: the hiring freeze post-financial crisis was
thawing, and the wave of candidates who had started postdocs in 2008 and applied
for faculty positions 2 or 3 years later had thinned.

<p>If you are in a "non-standard" CS field like HCI the numbers are probably
completely different. If you are trying to solve the academic two-body problem
you should be applying to at least 40 places. Some couples do 60.

<p>Claire was told by different people at different points in the year that the
number of positions to which she applied was (A) far too many, (B) far too few,
and (C) exactly right.  Make of that what you will.

<p>Zak applied to 15 jobs, had interviews at five, and received two offers.
For industrial-specific positions, he has three pieces of advice.  First,
cast a wide net by asking everyone you can about places they know that have
hired people in the past.  The idea here is that industrial jobs are
somewhat less &#34;searchable&#34; than academic positions and
word-of-mouth often tends to be much more helpful when finding places to
apply.  Second, consider places that might not immediately seem like a fit.
It turns out that jobs in industry can be somewhat more fluid and that it
is often easy to find a fit once you start talking to people at a given
company.  It certainly cannot hurt you to consider a wide range of
companies initially and narrow the pool down once you start talking to
people at said companies and getting a better feel for the types of
positions they have to offer.  Finally, the schedule for industrial hiring
seemed very much more fluid than the somewhat rigid academic semester-based
timeline. Some of the companies I initially talked to eventually contacted
me about positions well into the summer of 2014, even after I had started
my eventual job. Different companies work on different hiring schedules
and there were several I was disappointed to find out simply weren&#39;t
hiring when I was looking for jobs.  I&#39;d recommend starting the search
very early and contacting people at each potential employer to get an idea
for how often and when they tend to hire.  
  

<a name="area"><h3>Research Area and Where to Apply</h3></a>

All of the job postings you find in academia will use basically the same
boilerplate ad copy (e.g., "we encourage all qualified applicants from all
areas of computer science to apply, we are an equal-opportunity ...").
Beyond that, there are two ways the ads are typically formed: 
<ul>
<li> 
One says "we are particularly looking for people in bioinformatics and
datamining, ...", at which point you shouldn't get your hopes up unless
you're in those areas. Here's a concrete example from Purdue's 2005
search (emphasis ours):
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-2>
  The Department of Computer Sciences at Purdue University invites
  applications for tenure-track positions beginning August 2005. Positions
  are available at the Assistant Professor level; senior positions will be
  considered for highly qualified applicants. Applications from outstanding
  candidates in all areas of computer science will be considered. <i>Of
  particular interest are candidates in the areas of programming languages
  and compilers, software engineering, operating systems, data mining, and
  bioinformatics.</i>
</font>
</ul>

<li> The other kind of ad says "our department has strengths in areas X, Y
and Z and we are looking for people who can either augment or complement
those strengths", at which point you really have no information since
they've covered all of the bases. Here's a concrete example from Virginia's
2005 search (emphasis mine): 
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-2>
  The University of Virginia ranks consistently as one of the top public
  universities in the country. Its highly valued Department of Computer
  Science has a diverse population with more than 300 undergraduate
  students, 110 graduate students, and 28 faculty members. The department
  offers baccalaureate, master, and doctoral degrees in Computer Science
  and Computer Engineering. The department is undergoing significant growth
  and programmatic evolution and aims to be one of the top departments in
  experimental systems research and the leading institution in
  undergraduate computer science education. <i>Its existing strengths include
  algorithms, architecture, compilers, distributed systems, graphics, grid
  computing, mobile computing, networks, operating systems, programming
  environments, real-time and embedded systems, security, sensor networks,
  and software engineering.</i> 
</font>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>If your work spans more than one subfield, carefully consider the way you
position yourself and your work.  Departments have areas in mind when they
interview and assign applications to faculty in specific areas for
batch-processing.  Claire's publication record was, as of 2012/2013, fairly
evenly split between evolutionary computation and software engineering venues.
However, she considers herself primarily an SE researcher, and wanted to be
considered as such as an applicant.  She thus pitched herself as an "SE person"
who borrows insights from other fields (evolutionary computation/GP) as opposed
to a person who floats in the void between research areas.

<p>One notable exception to the "apply largely to schools specifically hiring in
your area" rule is the class of "top 1" schools.  CMU CS, for example, is huge,
and its school of computing has multiple departments.  Thus, its job ad is
typically very general in its call, and applications are routed based on area to
relevant departments or faculty.  These programs (especially the very big ones)
very rarely need to hire, and just do so when they find someone they like.
Thus, even if their calls are open, it's probably worth applying, because
apparently you never know.

<p>(Digression: Claire actually asked Wes if it was even worth sending
applications to those places given that "it wasn't going to happen."  He
insisted she apply, which is funny in retrospect. She is of the opinion
that her sincere belief that she wouldn't receive an
offer from CMU helped during the interview, because she wasn't especially
nervous or stressed out about messing up.)

<p><b>Claire:</b> <font color="#0099FF">It is my <i>personal opinion</i> that as a software engineering
researcher, where you apply can matter a great deal.  It is "accepted wisdom" in
the community that SE researchers do not receive invitations to interview for
open job calls that do not mention SE (or possibly PL).  By and large, I
observed this to be true.  All but maybe two of my interviews were at places
that listed SE or PL in their job ads explicitly.  One of the exceptions was
Waterloo, which has a long and storied software engineering tradition (as do
most Canadian institutions).

<p>To generalize, I would encourage you to apply to places that you have
reason to believe are interested in your research area, either based on
word-of-mouth or the job ad copy itself.  Examples: in 2012, NC State had an
established SE faculty leave for another position, while UIUC had an established
SE faculty retire.  Both specifically mentioned SE in their 2013 ads.  I
did apply to a few places with "open calls" based on location (and I would
encourage you to do the same), but it mostly didn't pan out.

<p>One more somewhat editorial note: there's typically a subfield that's "hot" in a
given hiring year, such as big data or health care informatics in 2013.  Please
don't pretend to do these things if you don't.  It's tacky and
obvious.</font>

<a name="org"><h3>Organizing Things For Your Letter-Writers</h3></a>

The standard practice these days is to make a web page or chart listing all of
the places to which letters must be sent as well as the due dates. 

<p>As of 2013, most schools use some kind of special online web-system for
applications.  If you are like Claire at all, you will be annoyed by the fact
that the systems are all basically the same, and yet you still need to generate
a new account at every one.  A few
use <a href="http://www.academicjobsonline.com">academicjobsonline.com</a>.  These
are by far the easiest positions to apply for.

<p>Regardless of system used, schools typically accept
letters of recommendation via email (i.e., "please submit letters to the
following address."; make it easy to cut and paste the addresses on your web
page) but they may issue an email to your letter-writers instructing them to
use an alternative form.  As of 2013, no positions required letters to be sent
physically, and most expressly disallowed it.  A couple of schools ask for
letters only after a first cut of applications, in which case they will contact your
letter-writers directly.

<p>Loosely, your letter-writers will write the letters a day or two before the
first one is due and then send them all out.
<p>
<a href="assets/materials/weimer/list.html">You can see Wes's letter-writer chart 
here.</a> It's not perfect and I'm sure you could improve on the format but no
one complained. It should also give you an idea of how the due dates vary
between top-tier teaching-ish schools (e.g., Oberlin at November 19) and
standard research schools (e.g. CMU at January 15). 
<p>
As an aside, it is <i>very common</i> for letters of recommendation to fail to
make it all the way to the people who need to see them.  It is typically very
difficult to distinguish between a world in which your letter-writer did not
submit a letter despite a request from a school; a world in which no such
request was issued; a world in which the letter-writer submitted a letter but
for some reason it was lost; and a world in which letters were all successfully
submitted.  Wes had at least six places email to say only one or two of his
letters got through, and asking to have the others emailed directly to some
address.  Some UC-system schools are infamous for letter mishaps (e.g., losing
more or less every letter from one year's worth of applicants). It is quite
reasonable to send follow-up email to your target departments asking if all of
your letters have made it in to your applicant file (this also shows interest in
the position, but it's unlikely anyone will notice at this stage).

<A name="prep"><h3>Preparing Your Application: Cover Letter and
Resume</h3></a>

Your application will almost invariably consist of a resume, a teaching
statement, a research statement and a cover letter.  Some schools also request
up to three "indicative publications."
<p>
The cover letter is the least important element, but if you get it wrong
your entire application may be mistakenly misfiled and not considered. The
key points to cover include who you are, what you are applying for (include
any special numbers) and what you are including. If someone on the inside
told you to apply, mention that. Here are concrete examples:
<ul>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/weimer/weimer-cover-letter.pdf">Weimer Generic Cover Letter</a>.
<li> <a href="assets/materials/jhala/rj-cover-generic3.pdf">Ranjit Jhala Generic Cover Letter</a>.
<li> <a href="assets/materials/weimer/weimer-cover-letter-umass.pdf">Weimer UMass-Amherst Cover
Letter (including job search number)</a>. 
</ul>
<p>
Resume-writing is well-established, although many of the standard
techniques aren't as applicable at this level (e.g., it is our personal
impression that your previous work experience doesn't really matter). You
want to emphasize your publications and any teaching experience you might
have. Also list all of your references one more time (sometimes people
actually call your references to get more information). If Wes were doing
this again he would list publication venues all at once in some
topic sentence (e.g., "I have published in POPL, PLDI, TOPLAS, OOPSLA,
...") because he saw people at interviews skim his resume for exactly
that summary while he sat before them. 
<p>
Along these lines, more than one person advised Claire to organize her
publication list by "type": "Journal Articles," "Refereed Conference
Publications," "Invited Articles", "Workshops," etc.  She was told that
listing all publications chronologically without distinguishing by venue
type can appear disingenuous, and that it is annoying for the reader (who
must evaluate dozens of applications at once) to spend time mentally
sorting the list (since workshops "count less" than other venue types).
She included journal impact factors and conference acceptance rates. She
highlighted venue acronyms and applicable awards in the left-hand column of
the publication list.  These decisions were intended to make her CV easier
to scan for this type of information, because interviewers look for it.
<p>
At many places the resume appeared to be the only thing that actually made it
through the application bureaucracy to people. At least four times, Wes saw
people explicitly looking over his resume either as he was coming in to the
interview or while he was sitting down. By contrast, he never heard anyone
mention his research statement.  Claire had similar experiences, but notes that
at at least two schools, at least one interviewer had read at least one of her
publications before sitting down with her.
<p>
Anyway, here are our resumes from when we were applying, which again serve
largely as a lower-bound on required content and style. Also included are a
few other examples. 
<ul>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/begel/begel-cv.pdf">Andy Begel Resume</a> 
<li> <a href="assets/materials/legoues/legoues-cv.pdf">Claire Le Goues Resume</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/lerner/lerner-cv.pdf">Sorin Lerner Resume</a> 
<li> <a href="assets/materials/weimer/weimer-resume.pdf">Weimer Resume</a> 
<li> <a href="assets/materials/whaley/whaley-cv.pdf">John Whaley Resume</a> 
<li> <a href="assets/materials/fry/fry-cv.pdf">Zak Fry Resume</a> 
</ul>

<p>Note that if you are applying for any sort of teaching job (e.g., top-tier
teaching academia, small liberal arts college, instructor position) your
teaching qualifications (courses taught and letters talking about it) should be
at least as good as Wes's and hopefully much better (more like Andy Begel's
above, say). Wes's were the bare minimum required (e.g., they sufficed to get him
an interview at Wesleyan) but they were mentioned as a concern (until he was able
to convince them with his presentation) and he has no doubt that other teaching
places rejected him because of them. Teaching jobs will also want multiple
numerical evaluations (e.g., Wes was asked explicitly what his numerical teaching
evaluations were at Wesleyan, and we imagine that they're even more serious about
it at other departments).

<a name="state"><h3>Preparing Your Application: Teaching and Research
Statements</h3></a>

The traditional approach here is to craft your research statement by
summarizing your thesis proposal and to craft your teaching statements by
looking at what others have written and fumbling around. Here are some
concrete examples:
<ul>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/begel/begel-research.pdf">Andy Begel Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/jhala/Jhala-Research.pdf">Ranjit Jhala Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/legoues/legoues-research-statement.pdf">Claire Le Goues Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/lerner/lerner-research.pdf">Sorin Lerner Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/weimer/weimer-research.pdf">Weimer Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/whaley/whaley-research.pdf">John Whaley Research Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/fry/ZakFry_ResearchStatement.pdf">Zak Fry Research Statement</a>
</ul>

<p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/begel/begel-teaching.pdf">Andy Begel Teaching Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/legoues/legoues-teaching-statement.pdf">Claire Le Goues Teaching Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/lerner/lerner-teaching.pdf">Sorin Lerner Teaching Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/jhala/Jhala-Teaching.pdf">Ranjit Jhala Teaching Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/weimer/weimer-teaching.pdf">Weimer Teaching Statement</a>
<li> <a href="assets/materials/whaley/whaley-teaching.pdf">John Whaley Teaching Statement</a>
</ul>
References aren't required in a research statement, but they don't hurt if
you feel better with them (or if you have a bunch of publications and want
to highlight that). 
<p>
Almost all teaching statements seem to end up looking somewhat identical
(see Lerner, Jhala and Whaley above). At Wesleyan, the only place Wes went
that mentioned his teaching statement at all, they mentioned that it was
creative and the best one they had seen in a while.  Given how interesting
his isn't, that gives you a good idea for how low the bar is set if you
want to do something personal with your teaching statement. Being
yourself is still key, however. Not everyone should go for a teaching
statement in which they claim not to be nice. Andy Begel's emphasis on
education results in something of an upper bound on teaching statement
impressiveness (unless you're actually in CS education), and a statement
like his would fit in well if you're aiming for a teaching job. 
<p>
It's worth noting that many people feel that their statements don't really
reflect who they are as people. Some are of the opinion that job
application materials necessarily adopt a "putting yourself forward" or
"please hire me" tone that's not indicative of how the person really
behaves in general. Writing these statements can take a surprisingly long
time because your own draft efforts will invariably sound stupid to you. 
<p>
Aside from asking your friends to show you their statements, a good way to
get these things is to download them one year early. Almost everyone puts
their job application materials up on their web page when they are applying
for a job. In May/June, Googling for <tt>programming languages "teaching
statement"</tt> yields hundreds of results. Just download some and save
them. Of course, if you get random people from the Internet you probably
won't have heard of them and thus won't know if they are good or bad
examples. So try to soak up all of the documents from people in your
department that you can get a read on.  
<p>
As of 2013, there exists a larger collection of such materials floating
around in the email archives of recently-hired junior faculty in Software
Engineering.  Contact Claire if you're seriously on the market, and she will see
if she can access it for you, so long as you solemnly vow to share your own
materials after your search concludes.
<p>
Make sure that yours are available
on-line as well. Many places, even places to which you have officially sent
materials, will get the versions off of your web page because the official
application materials get lost in the bureaucracy or were printed out
somewhere or somesuch. Wes was involved in multiple phone and sit-down
interviews where people mentioned reading the materials from his web page as
they were talking.  Half of your interviewers will look for/at your materials the
day/hour before they speak with you, and they will look on your website
first. 
<p>
While we're on the subject, people will, in fact, read the details of your web
page when they are considering you as a candidate. For example, Dave Evans at
Virginia mentioned (somewhat tongue-in-cheek, somewhat not) that one of the
reasons he knew Wes would fit in and be a solid hire is that he read and liked
the parody programming languages examination test on his web page. Both Wes and
Claire had multiple people comment on the photos or hobbies mentioned on their
web pages, even if those mentions were exceedingly brief (such as Claire's
involvement with her local roller derby league).

<a name="submit"><h3>Submitting Your Application</h3></a>

Nothing surprising here. Email it in or otherwise make use of the online form
system in question. Often they will ask for everything to be in PDF
format. Sometimes they'll even want everything in a single PDF file, so be
prepared to achieve that. 

<A name="wait"><h3>The Waiting Game</h3></a>

You probably submitted your materials in the middle of December. However, you
won't really hear anything from anyone until at least the middle of January when
the faculty can get together and review the applications. Be sure to check your
email during this time, including your spam folder!  At the end of
December 2004, Michigan sent Wes an email saying that there was a mix up with his
application and asking him to resend my letters of recommendation. Unfortunately,
it was sorted to his spam folder and he didn't find it until March, at which
point it was too late. Try to avoid losing potential interviews for reasons not
related to your merits.
<p>
While you're waiting you may receive a bunch of emails that say "we
received your application, we're starting a folder for it" or "we have
received all of your letters of recommendation".  

<p><b>Claire says:</b>  <font color="#0099FF">Try to resist compulsively checking your website's stats
on where your pageviews are coming from, because it will not make you feel
better, even though it is at least a little bit fascinating.</font>

<li>May 20. I accept CMU and turn down remaining offers.
</ul>
<sup>1</sup>Lincoln expressly deferred making an offer to try to line up with
the academic interview timeline.

<p> There are a few things to notice about these otherwise-boring timelines:
<ul>

<li>The spread of dates on the <font color="purple">interview
invitations</font> is wide.  Between Wes's first (Jan 11) and last (Apr
4) there were almost three entire months.  

<li> Even the spread between an interview invitation and an offer from one
department can be long (see: Claire and Georgia Tech).  Sometimes you are
the first of many candidates to interview.  Other times, you are choice #3
for a department with two slots, and they need to make offers to options #1 and
#2 first.  It is legitimate to email your host or the chair to let them
know about your other deadlines.

<li>Many <font color="green">official offers</font> will require answers before
you have heard all of your offers, conducted all of your interviews (such as
Purdue for Wes or NC State or UNM for Claire), or even received all of your
interview invitations.  CMU called to invite Claire to interview <i>after she
had concluded what she thought was her last interview (WUSTL).</i>  You may be
forced into the uncomfortable position of rejecting a "known good" offer in
favor of only the potential of a better offer later.  This can be scary, and if
you get the one job you really want you should take it, but Claire notes the
opportunities she would have missed if she'd signed an offer too early.  See
below on hard-sell tactics.

<li><font color="red">Explicit rejection notices</font> are rare (especially
without an interview) and are rarely early. Many places just never get back to
you.  Claire didn't even track which schools that did not interview her
officially rejected her and when. 
</ul>

<a name="hard"><h3>Deadlines and Hard-Sell Tactics</h3></a>

Official offers will often come with deadlines, especially if you are the
institution's current first choice but they have others "in line" in case you
reject the offer. This can lead to uncomfortable situations where you have to
decide on one offer without knowing about your other potential offers.
<p>
It is basically impossible to avoid this by scheduling all of your interviews in
one massive clump. Your interview offers will trickle in at a varying rate, and
even if all of the dates are available for you, not all of
the dates will be available at every university. Moreover, 
the practical limit is about 2.5 interviews per week -- and 2 is much
more reasonable. The travel time and the effort of being "on" for the
entire interview are hard to appreciate until you've actually done it.  Claire
only had one 2-interview week, and she strongly encourages you to avoid it.
<p>
Another way to cope is to ask for more time. If you explain the situation
honestly, many places will push back their deadlines. For example, Purdue was
willing to push their deadline for Wes back to effectively May 2.
Unfortunately, that can often still not be long enough (it wasn't for Wes, as
his timeline indicates).  Waterloo extended Claire's decision deadline to give
her the chance to do a second visit at UIUC.  
<p>
Finally, certain classes of offers rarely come with deadlines. Industrial
research labs (e.g., IBM and Microsoft) can typically afford to sit on an offer
for as long as you would reasonably like once it has been extended to you.
Claire's Lincoln Labs offer had a basically infinitely-extensible deadline.
Similarly, some academic offers effectively say "you are our first choice and
there is no one we will extend an offer to this year if you turn us down, so
take as long as you like to think about it."
<p>That said, it is reasonable to turn down a position as soon as you know you
are not going to accept it. You don't have to/shouldn't wait until right up
against their deadline "just to be polite."  The sooner they know, the easier it
is for them to make an offer to their next-favorite candidate.

<p><b>Wes:</b><font color="#990033"> It is my <i>personal opinion</i> (as opposed to the rest of this, but this
bit is really an editorial) that any offer with a deadline that you view as too
restrictive should be rejected. I realize that there are economic realities and
that most offers come with eventual deadlines, but you owe it to yourself to
check out all of your options. In essence, an offer that says "you're so
impressive to us that I want you to come here, get tenure, and work with us for
the rest of your life, but I'm not willing to give you another two weeks to get
all of the relevant information and think about things" is saying "I don't want
you to use you brain or it isn't worth it to me to let you use you brain, and I
think that my best shot at hiring you involves pressuring you into a situation
where you will make a snap judgment in my favor." Morality and honor typically
involve restricting your actions for some higher goal and often come with a
price (e.g., deciding not to steal rules out a bunch of actions that could get
you more money, choosing not to lie can make it difficult to explain certain
situations). For me, the price of potentially losing a more lucrative (or
otherwise better-appearing) potential job is one that I am willing to pay in
order to take the "honorable" action of avoiding such hard sell tactics.  In the
end, I wouldn't want to work at a place that didn't want me to take my time and
use my mind when considering where to work.</font>

<p><b>Claire:</b> <font color="#0099FF">I feel perhaps slightly less strongly on this issue, though I
never faced the choice of having to turn down one offer without another offer in
hand.  I have been told by various people that this behavior is more common from
and attractive to "lower ranked" schools, because they typically have to work
harder to interview and attract candidates.  Put differently: Stanford can be
reasonably confident that a candidate will accept their offer.
Ranked-75th-University may have to put out more offers to get a bite.  That
said, this is a difficult feature of the job search and I wish schools
could synchronize their schedules a bit more to avoid it.</font>

<p><b>Zak:</b> <font color="#008000">I will elide my timeline, as it does
not add much beyond the information present in Wes and Claire's outlines of
the process.  However, to echo an earlier point: the industrial positions I
applied to did not follow a very neat schedule.  I had to ask to extend an
offer by more than a month to allow for ample time to hear back from
other companies.  The company in question was mostly happy to oblige a
reasonable extension (as I'm told most are), but this is a part of the
process to be aware of, as it can be tedious.  I'd agree with Wes's
sentiments that any place that imposes an overly strict deadline may not be
a fun place to work, unless they are in a very advantageous bargaining
position. </font>

<a name="talk"><h3>Preparing Your Job Talk</h3></a>

Make sure that you schedule a practice job talk of some sort, if only with your
local research group. Everyone else will be able to give you advice on it. Make
sure that people who are not in your field or office come to your practice
talk. During your actual job talks, in general at most one or two other people
will be from your field and the rest of the room will be made up of people from
other domains within computer science.  Besides, the people in your subfield are
probably the reason you're being interviewed; people outside your subfield need
to be convinced.  The exception to this is industry. In large industrial
research labs, for example, you will basically only present to people in your
general area.
<p>
The general structure or content of a job talk are
easily available.  We will note that you should definitely include a
future work section.  If you are lucky enough to be at a department that hires
regularly, attend all the talks, even/especially the ones outside your field.
Take notes on how much introductory material, related work, detailed material,
and future work are presented. Then forget about it for nine months until you
have to craft your own.  
<p>
Although the average is "fifty minutes for the talk and ten minutes for
questions", different places will have different time requirements. At one stop
Wes was asked to fit the entire thing into 50 minutes. At another he had 75
minutes. Claire found a similar spread.  Prepare your talk in a modular manner
so that you can add or remove sections. Bonus points if you can do
this on the fly -- frequent interruptions are common and can suck up quite a bit
of time.  Try to avoid giving lengthy answers to questions posed in the middle
of your talk (answer the question, but be succinct).  At one venue Wes actually
had audio-visual difficulties (!) delay (and 
thus shrink) his talk for ten minutes.  Claire recommends you travel with your
own laptop and VGA adapter to defend against such hassles.  The exception is the
FFRDCs (like Lincoln Labs), where defense department rules will require you to
email your slides as PDFs ahead of time.

<p>
Claire changed her talk modestly between interviews.  Moving things around a bit
between presentations helped keep the talk fresh.  After you've done it a few
times, the jokes become very unfunny to you. Do what you can to avoid boring
yourself.

<p>At some schools, even for a research faculty position, you will be asked to
prepare either a short commentary on your teaching style (in 2013, Iowa State
requested 10 minutes of the job talk be dedicated to teaching), or an actual
teaching demo (Waterloo requested a 20-30 minute example lecture, given
separately from the job talk).  Claire advises you to not skimp on
teaching demo preparation.  It can make a big difference in helping you stand
out from the crowd, the rest of which probably did skimp.

<p>If possible, do a dry run at a school to which you're not applying.  For
example, in September 2012, Claire gave a colloquium talk at Virginia Tech.  It
wasn't nearly so intense as a real interview, and it was nice to practice
the talk with an unfamiliar audience before doing it for real.

<p>
There are different opinions on the "one-third one-third one-third"
rule of thumb. A common version suggests that one-third of your talk should
be understood by everyone in the room, one-third should be understood by
people in your general area (e.g., graphics, programming languages,
systems) and one-third should be understood "only by you". 
<p>
The trick here is that your job talk must serve many purposes. It must
convince them that you are a good lecturer (i.e., the talk must be engaging
and speak to your teaching abilities). It will also be their first exposure
to your work (as above, many people will be reading you resume at the
beginning of your interview -- unless you're at a small department, don't
expect anyone beyond your host to know anything about you or your work
unless you say it to them) and must help to convince them that your
research has substance. This point is actually somewhat tricky, because if
they asked you for an interview they probably already believe your work is
good enough (based on you resume, letters, and the local evaluation of the
department members closest to your subfield). 
<p>
It is the <i>personal opinion</i> of both Wes and Claire (thus, no
color-coding!) that basically the
entire talk should be understandable to everyone in the room. Motivation is
key. Remind people of why the entire field of programming languages (or whatnot)
is worth considering. A tenured AI professor (as a random example) may well
think that "compilers are a solved problem" and it won't hurt to remind such a
person that there is exciting stuff going on here.  Claire often used the phrase
"This is really exciting because" to help her audience roadmap key
contributions.  Keeping everyone interested will help to convince them of you
teaching potential. In addition, if people cannot understand your talk they have
no way to spot potential collaborations. Our job talks were both designed to be
easily understood by everyone (heavy on motivation, context, analogies and
pictures). We both received many comments from people about just how
understandable they were and we also got quite a few offers for collaboration
based on them (e.g., graphics and database people were able to see possible
fits, not just PL/SE people). Wes specifically asked people after his talk
if the lack of "Greek letters" or "complicated-looking material" hurt his
case. Typical responses included "it wasn't a problem because were able to see
how intelligently you handled yourself when answering the questions" or "it was
fine because we already know how good your work is" or "no, not at all."
However, Claire was advised of the 1/3-1/3-1/3 rule many times throughout her
job search.  Thus we
cannot give you a blanket guarantee that following our approach won't hurt your
employability. We were willing to take that risk to stand up for something we
believed in. We encourage you to consider it carefully.  Finally, the exception
here is industrial research (e.g., Microsoft, IBM): skimp on motivation in such
settings -- it will just bore them. It probably won't count against you (because
they explicitly mention that they realize that no one prepares two job talks and
that the intro is appropriate in academia) but you can possibly earn bonus
points by tailoring your talk to those audiences.

<a name="visit"><h3>Interview Visits</h3></a>

A typical interview is 1.5 days long, depending largely on the size of the
department (bigger department=more people to meet=longer
interview). You will arrive near dinner time on day X. Someone may or may not
meet you at the airport and may or may not take you to dinner with one or two
others. You sleep and wake up on day X+1, someone may optionally arrive to take
you to breakfast, you head to the venue, and do the interviews. You first
meeting (dinner, breakfast, or interview) is typically with your host. After that it's random. It is completely
legitimate to take notes the entire time (we both did).  This will be 
helpful later when you are trying to recall the conversations you had and the
people you met.  There's a break for lunch at a nice restaurant with two to four
others, then more interviews. This will last until around 5pm, at which point
they'll take you to dinner (unless they did it before, but multiple dinners are
not uncommon) and then you sleep.  For a long interview (e.g., IBM research,
Georgia Tech, UIUC, or large departments in general) things continue the next
morning until lunch. You may optionally arrange for the department to set up a
visit with a real-estate agent for you (if you're staying an extra half-day, for
example). Despite the fact that this seems incredibly presumptuous (since they
haven't hired you yet), it's not insulting or awkward. Even if they don't extend
you an offer, getting a feel for that area will give you a broader basis for
comparison when you are considering your actual offers.  Claire made such
arrangements during her second visits.
<p>
Almost all of your time will be spent in offices talking to people
individually. There are really only three main factors that vary between
interview visits. One is the length of each individual interview: anywhere
from 30 minutes to 60 minutes is common. The next is how many individual
interviews you have scheduled. The last is whether your job talk is early
or late. If the talk is later in the day you will have to include a five
minute "elevator" summary of your research at each of your individual
interviews. If the talk is late and the interview slots are thirty minutes,
don't expect to get anything done. If the talk is early you can use that
time to discuss potential collaborations or answer questions they have (and
they will have them!) about your talk. 
<p> 
You will probably have a meeting (or lunch) with the dean (or department
head or upper-level division manager or somesuch). This meeting tends to be
slightly different from all of your other interview chats. At many places
(e.g., Purdue) you will hear about exciting developments and expensive
multi-disciplinary centers being built. Initially this may well sound
irrelevant to you. You should view this sort of thing as a listing of
possible collaborations and sources of funding. You may well receive a copy
of the department's "strategic plan". Other places are of the opinion that
you can either spend your time writing strategic plans or you can spend
your time doing actual work. Ask the dean where the department is going
(invariably the department is growing and going up in the rankings, unless
you're already MIT or McGill, at which point the department is working
hard to maintain its number-one-in-the-country ranking) and what has
changed in the last few years. Ask the dean to forecast things seven years
into the future (you'll have tenure then). Ask the dean about the hiring
plans for the next few years. If all else fails, ask the dean
about the retirement plan (it shows long term interest and you probably
don't know anything about them yet as a grad student). 
<p>Claire met with at least three deans who had reviewed her application and had
questions about her research.  This was more common when the dean was a computer
scientist. Tidbit: as of 2013, the dean at CMU's School of CS still maintains an
active research program (focusing largely on systems).  Their conversation was
quite similar to a standard interview meeting, and Claire has since learned that
the dean in question is absolutely invested in the technical contributions of
anyone to whom the school makes an offer. This was non-typical.
<p>
Separate from the dean interview is the interview with the department chair
(or local hiring manager). This is typically the last interview in the
trip. The chair should suggest that they are still in the middle of their
interview process but that they will have completed all of their interviews
and concluded their deliberations in X days. Get this figure as firmly as
you can and write it down. The chair will also want to know what your
time frame for making decisions is (e.g., when will you be done with
your interviews). Ask why they are hiring. Is it to develop courses? Bring
in students? Do more research? Bring in grant money? Grow the department?  Ask
if they expect to continue to hire in the future, and how much they have hired
in the past.
<p>
When you are emailing back and forth to set up the interview, arrange for a
meeting with grad students if it is not otherwise on offer (most schools arrange
such a thing by default). This can be over lunch or in some common meeting room
during one of your slots. Be wary of any academic place that won't let you meet alone
with grad students (or undergrads if you're at a college). You'll probably get
at least three or four students at once; Claire had meetings with up to
10-15. The more people in these meetings, the more difficult they can be,
because the candidate has to lead the discussion. 
<p>
Sometimes the students will have seen your talk and will have (often very good)
questions.  Claire's toughest grilling during her interviews by far was at the
hands of graduate students.  However, much of the time the students will be
young (first or second year) and often won't really have anything to say.
Occasionally they will ask tough questions like "what will you bring to this
department that we don't already have?" or "how does your research influence
your teaching?" or "what courses will you offer when you first arrive?" or "how
will you choose your grad students?". You should have answers to all of these
anyway -- don't be like Wes and get surprised by them in real-time.
<p>
Aside from that, you should take time to ask a bunch of questions, such as about
their research, the program requirements, their background, and so on. Claire
tried to think of issues that mattered to her as a graduate student and ask
about them, such as if they felt the faculty was responsive to their concerns or
how much their input on this particular meeting mattered in the hiring process.
See below for more ideas about what you might ask.

<p>
It really doesn't matter what you wear, so wear what makes you the most
comfortable.  No one will remember if you wore coordinated separates
instead of a full suit.  They might remember if you were obviously
uncomfortable in your clothes or if you couldn't walk because of your
shoes.  If you are comfortable in a suit and have one that fits you and you
want to wear it, go ahead.  If you are purchasing your first suit since
high school to interview, abort.  Both Claire and Wes pulled their
interview outfits from their existing wardrobes.  If you do want to wear a
suit of some kind, practice giving talks and sitting around in it before
your interviews.

<p> It is basically impossible to communicate in advance how tiring the
interview process is, especially since interview season is also prime
get-stuck-because-of-snow season. Flying every other day (especially from coast
to coast) is exhausting (East Coasters have a real advantage in terms of jet
lag). Plus you'll lose an hour taking the BART to the airport and then getting
the rental car and whatnot. With time zone shifts you'll never really be able to
get a good meal in transit (except for the ones they take you to) so you'll be
eating too much airport food. Aim for a salad over McDonald's, and pack some
snacks. Beyond that, though, being "on" for a day and a half can be
draining. Aside from these interviews it's rare to spend nine hours (!)
consecutively talking to people about complicated topics, knowing that your
future employment is on the line. You must smile and be friendly and in a good
humor the whole time. It's not difficult but it does take more energy than you
think. Talking to professors you don't know for a nine hours is not like talking
to your friends for nine hours. Consider taking Dramamine or sleeping pills or
somesuch just to ensure that you get some rest on the plane.  Claire always
travels with ear plugs, an eye mask, melatonin, and a kindle/book to help sleep,
as well as a bathing suit and workout clothing to take advantage of hotel gyms
when available.  Take care of yourself physically.  You do yourself no
favors if you are so tired and strung out that your are no longer at your mental
best.

<A name="questions"><h3>Interview Questions</h3></a>

The majority of the interview is made up of one-on-one sessions between you
and an elder researcher you've never met before. Expect the worst-case
scenario: you will have to fill the entire 45 minutes yourself by asking
questions. Here are some questions (and follow-ups) one or both of us asked (and, where
applicable, the canonical cross-institution answer). 
<ul>
<li> What's the funding situation like here? Have you had good luck with
grants recently? When you were a new faculty member did you get much help
with grant-writing? 
<li> Everyone has only great things to say about this place. What's your
least favorite part about working here? 
<li> What can you tell me about the quality of the graduate students here?
How did you go about picking your first few grad students? I've heard
rumors that a bad grad student can be a big drain on a new professor -- how
do you avoid that? 
  <ul>
  <li> Answer at schools outside the top 10: The average graduate student here isn't as good as the
  average graduate student at Berkeley, so you can't always just take one
  from the pool and be assured of getting a winner. However, the best grad
  students here are just as good as the best ones anywhere else -- it's
  just that the tail of the distribution is longer. 
  <li>Answer at schools from 5-10: The students here are great, but we lose our
  best candidates to Berkeley/MIT/CMU.
  <li>Answer at schools in the top 5: The students here are stellar. 
  </ul>
<li> How important is technology transfer or working with the product
divisions? What's the funding model here? What happens if I pick something
to work on and no one in development seems to like it? How do I go about
making contacts with developers? How much academic freedom is there? 
<li> What's the tenure process like here? Can I suggest my own
letter-writers? Are there mid-point reviews? Is there a "magic formula"?
How many people have failed to get tenure in the last 10 to 15 years? 
  <ul>
  <li> Research Answer: There's no magic formula. Teaching, research and
  service are all important. Officially you must be stupendous at two of
  the three and fair at one. However, you can't really pick research (or
  teaching) as the one to be bad at. Teaching can only hurt you -- we will
  look at your numerical teaching evaluations and if they are below a
  cut-off you fail to get tenure. Otherwise we ignore teaching. The amount
  of grant money you bring in may or may not be a tenure consideration. We
  care about paper and venue quality, not quantity. One or two journal
  papers helps. Before going up for tenure you should teach at least one
  undergrad class. 
  </ul>
<li> Friends of mine who are professors at other universities have had to
hide their teaching awards when they went up for tenure. The subtext was
that if you had that much time to be spending on teaching you should have
spent it on research. What are things like here? 
<li> What's the teaching load? Does it change after you get tenure? Can you
"buy out" of a class? What does that cost? Who decides what you teach? 
<li> What's it like being a new single/married faculty member here? How did
you make friends when you first came to the area? Was it easy to find
things to do? 
<li> Are the faculty young or old? Is the university structured and
hierarchical? Do decisions come down from on high? How much power do young
faculty members have? 
<li> What's it like to live here? How long is your commute? 
<li> What's the worst example of office politics you've run into here? What
do people fight over?
  <ul>
  <li> Answer: We're very collegial. We don't really have office politics.
  No one gets mad at anyone else. We sometimes squabble over space.
  </ul>
<li> What's the general view on programming languages (or whatever) here?
Is it a second-class citizen? Is theory emphasized? Practice? Building big
systems? 
</ul>

<p>Generally, try to have a set of these questions lined up. For two days,
people will repeatedly ask you if you have questions for them.  Claire just
repeated hers when necessary.

<p>
Questions they may ask you:
<ul>
<li> <b>Tell me how your interests are aligned with some of the faculty here.
Who could you work with? </b>
  <ul>
  <li> This was by far the most common question. We encourage you to write
  down in some obvious place (e.g., at the top of your notebook) the name
  of anyone you think you could collaborate with so that you can answer
  this question intelligently. 
  </ul>
<li> <b>Are you married? Do you have a two-body problem?</b>
  <ul><li>See below on the <a href="#twobody">two-body problem.</a>  
  </ul>
<li> What will your CAREER award be about? 
<li> What will your first student's Ph.D. topic be (in general)? How many
students do you plan to have? 
<li> What courses would you be willing to teach? Are you interested in
creating new courses? 
<li> How will you divide your time between research, teaching and service? 
<li> What sort of research will you be doing in the future? 
  <ul>
  <li>This is also a very common question.  Nominally your job talk will have addressed this, but they may ask
  again in a more general sense -- do you think you'll be in programming
  languages (for example) forever, or do you see yourself shifting to
  systems or graphics? Take this opportunity to distance yourself from your
  advisor if need be -- you want to argue that you can pursue your own work
  for tenure. In Claire's experience, the more prestigious the institution, the
  more emphasis they give to this sort of question, sometimes phrased explicitly
  as "What do you envision your tenure case looking like?"
  </ul>
<li> Where do you get most of your funding? NSF? Other government agencies?
Corporate funding? 
</ul>

Several of these questions are secretly trying to determine if you have a clue
about how the faculty job works, especially regarding the aspects to which
graduate students are not always exposed.  For example, "have you considered
funding sources for your work?" is mostly an attempt to determine if you have
the remotest idea how the grant system works.  

<p>
Wes typically used up almost all of the time asking questions of the other
person. Remember, you are there to interview them as well.  Moreover, apparently
there are candidates who can't keep a conversation going after the first
five minutes, which is the kiss of (awkward) death (Claire heard this from
people interviewing her in several departments).  You would like to
convince the faculty that you are a person they wouldn't mind
working/sharing a hall with.  Being able to hold a reasonable conversation
for 30 minutes is a good start. 

<p><b>Zak:</b> <font color="#008000"> Zak would first note that for any type of interview, having looked up the people on your schedule and noted at least some work they've done recently goes a long way in the one-on-one interviews.  Many people seemed genuinely surprised when I brought up a recent paper and had questions and comments about it.  Additionally, I cannot speak to the types of questions asked in academic job interviews, but I was somewhat surprised at the number and range of technical questions asked of me during interviews.  Studying up on common interview topics (theory and algorithms, mostly) will only benefit you in the regard. </font>

<a name="twobody"><h3>Dual-Career Couples/Divulging Your Partnered Status</h3></a>

Context: Wes was single when he was on the market; Claire had a partner who was
planning to move with her and find a job in the software industry.  Wes
mentioned his relationship status in his cover letters; Claire did not.  The
advice in this section applies to both regular dual-career couples and those
facing the actual academic two-body problem. However, as we are less experienced
with the latter situation, we cannot provide as much insight on the subject.  If
you are in that position, we encourage you to talk to others who have done a
two-body academic search for more concrete and informed advice.

<p>As mentioned above, you may be asked about your marital status during your
interviews.  Claire actually never had anyone ask her this outright. Perhaps
times changed since 2005, or perhaps interviewers are more sensitive about the
issue with a female candidate than they are with a male candidate.  Regardless,
this question is illegal. 
<p>
<b>Wes says:</b> <font color="#990033"><i>everyone may ask anyway</i> (even if you have put the answer
explicitly on the front of your resume). Just deal with it. I have at least two
data points of people being put in very awkward positions here (one was loosely
"we have a lot of great women on campus and if you can't find someone within a
few years there's something wrong with you" and the other was loosely "what's
you religion and sexual orientation?"). Have a nice way to back out of such
conversational cul-de-sacs. If you are asked anything more intrusive than "are
you married?"  feel free to mention it to your host. It's better to point this
out to someone who likes you than to have the evil questioner's possibly
negative opinion of you hurt your chances.</font>
<p>
<b>Claire says:</b> <font color="#0099FF"><i>everyone really wants to know and you should
almost certainly tell them.</i>  During my interviews, I would
find a way to drop my partner's existence and job ambitions into an early
conversation. <i>In every case</i>, I was met with a relieved "Oh I'm so glad
you told me that because we really want to know and we can't ask."  I strongly
encourage you to be open and honest about any two-body or dual-career situation
you may have.  The sooner a department knows about your partner's job needs, the
more likely it is that they can find something for your partner in time to
convince you that accepting the position is beneficial for you and your family.
There is a school of thought that one should wait until one knows a department
is interested before divulging a two-body situation.  However, I have seen this
backfire for other couples more than once, in that by the time an offer is on
the table, it is too late to arrange for an interview with another department.
This is obviously a bigger problem if your partner is also in academia.
<p>
I freely admit that I am lucky in that my spouse has made very portable career
choices.  That said, I was extremely upfront about my partner and his job
aspirations, and departments that made me offers simultaneously made connections
for him at local companies.  He even did some onsite interviews during second
visits.
<p>
The interview process is a giant two-party courtship exercise in which the
interviewee is trying to convince the department to make a job offer, and the
interviewer is trying to convince the interviewee that the department/location
is the ideal place to live/work.  As such, a legitimate department at which you
want to work should fall over backwards to convince you that they can get your
spouse/partner a job.  Anecdotal example: The dean at UIUC opened his meeting
with me by saying "I am not interested in your family circumstances, and it
would be inappropriate and illegal for me to ask you about them.  However, I
would like to share with you unprompted all of UIUC's policies regarding
dual-career couples..."
<p>
Look at it this way: The only reason not to be up front about this issue is that
you are worried that doing so will hurt your job prospects.  However, if a
department (illegally) decides not to hire you because your spouse needs a job,
you probably would not have gone there anyway, because
<i>your spouse would not have had a job in time for the decision to be
reasonable.</i> Moreover, and I freely admit that this statement arises from my
privileged position of working in an academic field that is, by and large,
hiring: I personally do not want to work with people who will not hire me
because I am in a romantic partnership or because I have or may one day have
family obligations. If anyone decided not to interview me or offer me a
position for these reasons, they would have saved me the trouble of having to
uncover their misogyny some other way.</font>
<p><b>Zak says:</b> <font color="#008000"> On the topic of being honest about things and covering somewhat personal topics, I feel as though I should mention that coming across like a real person is helpful in a heavily technical field like ours.  While I may be biased, as I felt like I came from a somewhat less-strong technical foundation, I found that people genuinely appreciated me trying to make idle conversation and be personable.  There are plenty of tips in, for instance, the business world about being personable, but I think people in all industries look for potential employees that they think they could work with every day on a personal level.</font>
<p>
One final note on partners and jobs: emigrating to Canada with a partner appears
to be pretty trivial, based on Claire's (serious) conversations with Waterloo on
the subject.  The Canadian immigration system is much more straightforward than
the US system (as of July 2013), and their HR departments are practiced in
providing support for the process.


<a name="salary"><h3>Salary and Startup Negotiations</h3></a>

At some point someone will make you an official offer. This will include
your nine-month salary and a startup package. The startup package should
include money for graduate students (two students for two years each is
typical), travel and equipment. It should also include discretionary funds. 
Your initial contract will probably be for three years, at which point they
will evaluate things and then re-hire you, and then a few years later you
go up for tenure. The year in which one goes up for tenure is fairly
standard, but can vary (e.g., at 5 years in Canada, 9 at CMU, 10 at
Yale/Hopkins, etc.).  Be sure to check, just to be informed. 
<p>
Everyone knows everyone else and what the going rate is, so if you don't do
anything about it all of your offers from the same job category will be
quite similar. Thus, haggling. 
<p>
The first thing to note is that haggling is controversial and unsettling.
Some people believe that you should just do good work for the good money
they offer you and not become known as one of those grasping department
members who always has to have more than everyone else. In general,
salary negotiations do not take place, because graduate students
have no experience with haggling and find the process uncomfortable.
Talking so bluntly about money and putting yourself forward to get more of
it can be distasteful. Since your new salary will be four or five times
what you are making as a grad student, it may seem like it's not worth
making yourself uncomfortable to get another thousand or two. 
<p>
The trick here is that almost all of your raises will be cumulative and
percentage-based. By the laws of compound interest your starting salary
becomes critically important, especially since you're going to be there for
at least twenty years. With one exception, everyone Wes and Claire have talked to was in
favor of haggling for your starting salary. Responses were either "I
didn't do it and now I regret it" or "I did it and it didn't work, but you
should try it" or "I did it and it worked and I'm glad". The common
consensus seems to be that you owe it to your family and future kids and
mortgages to try to get paid what you are worth. 
<p>
OK, now that we've decided that selfishness is a virtue (sorry, couldn't
resist), how do we go about haggling? 
<p>
The first thing to note is that although you will be conducting this
process with the department chair (or hiring manager or whatnot) who sent
you the official offer, <i>it doesn't hurt them and they are not really
involved</i>. If you ask for $5k you're not taking $5k out of the chair's
salary or even the chair's budget. The chair will go to the dean and convey
your request (and typically argue for it). The dean will come back with
something and the chair will relay that you. Do not adopt a zero-sum
mentality here -- you'll hamstring yourself. In industry the situation is
even more clear-cut -- you're not negotiating with your manager, you're
often negotiating with someone in HR or Accounting or somesuch. 

<p><b>Claire:</b> <font color="#0099FF">This is true for both salary and
startup negotiations.  Negotiating is standard, and they will not think
less of you, unless (I suspect) you're "unreasonable" or rude.  I will
claim that I did my best to be fair and make reasonable requests and to do
so politely.  I have been told that my requests to at least one school were
"all reasonable, professional, and polite." I have also been told that this
is not always the case: "some hires send seven pages of detailed demands."
I don't know what the line is between reasonable and unreasonable, nor if I
succeeded at staying on the correct side of it in all cases, but I
certainly made a good-faith effort.</font>
<p>
Anyway, so they've given you an offer with a starting salary of X. How do
you ask more without just saying "give me more money"? There are two
traditional approaches. 
<ul>
  <li> One approach works by comparison. If you already have a higher offer
  they will probably match it (this isn't a guarantee -- Wes's UMass offer was
  not matched by NYU, for example, and if the schools are far apart in
  rankings they may not play this game). You may well have to send them a
  copy of the other offer to show the dean. This is the easiest approach.
  Basically, you say that you would really like to work here but that you
  have a higher offer from another comparable place. Can they match it?
  They'll get right on it. 
  <li> The other approach is just ask for more money. Mention that you
  think the salary is low or that the cost of living there is high or that
  (you'll never do this, but hey) you're a strong researcher with a
  promising research career coming from Berkeley with a
  better-than-respectable resume and that you think you're worth a bit
  more. 
</ul>
Evaluate benefits, especially health care, along with salary offers.  One of the
offers Claire received included a fairly high salary compared to her other
offers, but provided notably expensive health insurance that largely
counteracted the salary advantage as compared to other schools (especially given
her chronic medical condition).  You can mention
this type of issue in negotiation conversations.

<p>Regardless, you never want to turn things into an "or-else" or "ultimatum"
situation. Phrasing is key: "your offer is not the most attractive offer
available to me" rather than "give me more or I'm leaving." The fact that
they made you an offer means that they want you. They are sort of on your
side even though they are negotiating. It's also valid to ask to what
extent the salary is negotiable. In many places (e.g., Berkeley, Microsoft)
you obtain permission to hire someone at a certain "level" or "rank" or
"band" and that strictly limits the starting salary range to within two or
three thousand dollars. 
<p>
Claire found that there was wide variability in the flexibility that schools had
regarding salaries, especially between state schools.  In her experience,
state and public schools are free and open with the details of their offers
with everyone, because their salaries are typically public knowledge.
Department chairs at private schools often keep those details very close to
the vest.

<p>
It may be difficult to adjust your starting salary, but you'll probably find
it easier to change your startup package. You can try to ask for more
students, more discretionary funding, or for the entire startup package to
be discretionary (e.g., "I will be able to live with the amount of money
you're offering me if you allow me to spend it any way I like"). 
<p>
This is easier if you can justify your request(s).  For example, Claire blocked
out some travel plans (for some reason, SE conferences in 2013-2015 are all in
far-flung locations, a fact that she mentioned in startup discussions) and
detailed computing equipment.  Ask about department policies on both student
and faculty equipment.  Some departments replace faculty and student computers
every couple of years out of a special fund.  In others, all such replacements
come from faculty budgets.  Ask about the computing facilities and
what kinds of availability guarantees they provide, and whether costs such as IT
support, compute time, or printing are charged to faculty funds.  By the way,
everyone will tell you that they have state-of-the-art computing facilities that
will meet your needs perfectly.  Your goal is to identify exactly what you need
to make sure that it's actually available.  For example, Claire often needs
to execute and manage large numbers of
virtual machines based on a custom image (think Amazon EC2).  Very few
departments can provide this kind of support as of 2013. She planned to purchase
a minimal cloud setup from startup funds and used the specs to support her
requests during startup negotiations.
<p>
By some combination of these approaches (considering and comparing across all
offers) Wes was able to increase his (lowest) starting salary by 3.6% and double
his (lowest) startup funds. Claire did not track her "haggling success" in this
way, but she negotiated at least a little bit with every department that
made an offer on both salary and startup, and in all cases was met <i>at
least</i> in the middle on at least some portion of her requests.  
<p>
You can expect industrial salaries to be 12/9ths of a nine-month academic
salary. However, raises in industry are much more common. For example, a
friend of Wes's has gotten a 10% raise every year for the last five or six
years. Industry raises range between 0% and 15% yearly. You also get
bonuses in industry. 
<p>
<b>Company trivia:</b> Friends of Wes's at IBM have suggested that on a starting
salary offer of $110,000 you should ask for another $10,000 right off the
bat (and that they'll do it without blinking an eye). If for some
reason you can't bring yourself to do that that it would be "criminal" not
to ask for $5,000. However, multiple data points at Microsoft Research
suggest that it is very difficult to haggle for starting salaries there
because of internal strictures; the same goes for Google. Wes only knows of one success story haggling
at Microsoft, and Claire has never heard of anyone succeed at Google.
<p>
Find out when your startup funds expire. In addition, make sure (in writing)
that your grad student funding includes the summer months. A friend of Wes's ended up in
a situation where he "took their word" that it extended to include the summer
and they came back to him later and made a fuss because it wasn't written in the
contract.  This advice ("get it in writing") applies to basically everything,
perhaps especially the teaching leave you can expect as a new hire.
<p>On the subject of Canada: you can definitely negotiate with Canadian schools
just as much (if not more so, in some cases) as you can with US schools.  Note,
however, that offers from Canada are basically incomparable in every way to
offers from the US, because their funding system is completely different, so
comparative negotiation is hard.  Note also that Canadian schools are especially
careful about avoiding salary inversion, but that, like the vast majority of US
state schools, their salary information is public.  Look it up for your
negotiation purposes.
<p><b>Claire:</b> <font color="#0099FF">In the interest of full disclosure,
I didn't ask for a higher salary at all schools. Whether I did or not
depended on the offer, especially as compared to my other offers.  I did
negotiate with every department that made me an offer, however, at least on
startup.  Honestly, I found negotiating very difficult.  However, it grew
easier with practice.  The first couple of negotiation emails I wrote took
me hours to compose and send.  By contrast, for my final set of
negotiations, I initiated the conversation on the phone with the department
chair during the "initial offer" conversation.</font>
<p>
Finally, if you think you want to haggle but you need more advice about it,
email your local department head (or past department heads). They have
probably seen it many times from both sides of the fence and are often
willing to give advice (it worked for Wes). 


<A name="reject"><h3>Dealing With Rejection</h3></a>

After you have had an interview with a place there are basically only two
reasons for them to reject you. 
<ul>
<li> One is that they "couldn't build a consensus." Variants on this phrase
are common. Since you'll be there for a long time (e.g., with tenure) it's
important that everyone get along. Thus if one or two people argue against
you, your odds of getting a job there are low. However, since you were
offered an interview there were at least a few people who liked you, so
rather than being able to say "everyone hated you" they will say "we
couldn't form a strong consensus". 
<li> Another possibility is that you were their second or third choice ("in
line") and that the first person they offered the job to accepted it. 
</ul>
You should tread carefully in the time period after your interviews but
before your official offers. Many department chairs have told Wes that they
view it as part of their job (or their responsibility to the department) to 
put the brightest face on this possible and essentially to "string you
along" or "never say no" (and thus keep as many good options for the
department open as possible). Thus a department chair saying "we're still
deliberating" may well mean "we've made a job offer to someone else already
and we're waiting to see how that goes". It has been suggested that
grad students who are naive about the interview process will interpret
"we'll get back to you in a week or two" the wrong way and may thus end up
waiting too long for a job offer that never arrives. In such a case you
should talk to your host or other department members in your area to get 
the inside scoop. 
<p><b>Wes:</b> <font color="#990033">It is my <i>personal opinion (and experience)</i> that this isn't really
the case. All of the places that said to me variants of "we're still
interviewing candidates and we'll have our faculty meeting to decide in 2
weeks" ended up making me an offer in 2 weeks -- it wasn't some sort of
smokescreen. Similarly, places that didn't think they were going to be able
to make me an offer (e.g. McGill) told me the rumor early (e.g., "we're
having trouble building consensus, I can't give you any reason to wait for
us") when I asked -- long before they sent an official reject letter. 
This is another case where being more direct or honorable can cost you job offers.
I was willing to deal with people in good faith and assume that they were
not lying to me when they said they would get back to me later. For me it
turned out that they were not lying, but I was willing to take the risk
that they were (and thus that I would wait too long for something that
would never materialize and lose my good offers along the way).  A place
that mentions that they play the "positive spin, never say no" game may
well be dealing intelligently with a harsh economic reality, but you may
not want to work there (cf. office politics).  </font>

<p><b>Claire:</b> <font color="#0099FF">Similarly, I found that most
schools and chairs were very straightforward with my position on their
"list" and the likelihood of an offer.</font>

<a name="decide"><h3>Deciding</h3></a>

If you're having a hard time deciding, it's quite legitimate to go on a second
visit (or two).  Claire found these quite informative.  She and her partner went
on such visits together and arranged a "date night" at each one in an effort
to simulate what it might be like to live in the place in question.  As
mentioned, Claire's partner also did onsite interviews with companies or otherwise consulted
with department members or others about employment opportunities on such visits.

Other than that: <br>
<p><b>Wes:</b> <font color="#990033">Talk to everyone. Don't forget to consult yourself. I
can't really help you here generically. </font>
<p><b>Claire:</b> <font color="#0099FF">I waited to have complete information for all offers before
making a decision.  I also asked for advice from as many people as possible,
though for the most part this didn't help. I did not choose my position on rank
alone, and it's unlikely that you should.  Wes suggests that I should say more
on this because I ended up at highly-ranked CMU. This decision is mostly
related to what matters to you in life and what makes you happy.  I
sincerely believe that I could have worked and lived happily in all of my
options.  In the end, some combination of department quality and
composition and, very critically, location, led CMU to win the day.  I like
cities, and Pittsburgh is cool, and it is conveniently located for both my
family and my partner's family.  It also has a fairly large tech scene,
allowing my spouse to get a job.  The fact that CMU CS is a highly ranked
department was not irrelevant, but it is not the only reason I accepted the
position.  See below for more commentary on department rankings.

<p>I found deciding very difficult.  You will end up connecting, hanging out,
and talking with a large number of people at every school, and it's hard to turn
down new friends.  One aspect of the job decision process that surprised me was
how much time I spent on the phone with faculty at various departments,
discussing their lives.  Unlike negotiation, writing the "turn down the offers"
emails never got any easier.</font>

<p><b>Zak:</b> <font color="#008000"> Talk to everyone, several times.  I
had my mind made up based on my assumptions about both places from which I
had offers.  After talking to Wes a lot, I was contacted by the place I had
decided not to go to and, after two subsequent conversations, I now work
there.  It's impossible to ask all the right questions or get all the
information about any given place, but if you have concerns about a certain
place then talk to them about it.  They should be more than eager to talk to
you about things (if not, that's a bad sign) and you might find that you
made hasty, or even incorrect, assumptions in this difficult, emotional
time. </font>

<a name="trivia"><h3>Trivia</h3></a>

Here are some random things that didn't fit in elsewhere. 
<ul>
<li>
In 2005 Purdue got 380 applicants for 3 job spots in CS and held 14
interviews. In programming languages alone they got 20 applicants and held
6-7 interviews for one spot. In 2005 Virginia got 457 applicants for 4
faculty positions. 
<li> 
Read the <a href="http://www.cra.org/statistics/">CRA Taulbee survey</a>. 
<li>
Many people will tell you that if all else fails, use rankings to break
ties. Better ranked schools will have better grad students and will find it
easier to get grant money. One problem with this is that different people
remember the rankings differently. Whenever you ask someone for advice, ask
for a relative ranking of your schools. You'll be surprised at how many
complete inversions you receive. 
<li> 
A personal recommendation or inside champion can be a great boost and can
help in case of a tie. If you are trying to end up at school X and you know
someone at Y who is friend with someone at X, having Y them briefly mention
you positively to X won't hurt you. 
<li>
Before the interview you should go over everyone on the faculty web page
and find people with research interests similar to your own. Learn the
names of their projects (at least!). 
<li>
Do not expect to accomplish any work (beyond giving a conference talk)
between February and May. 
<li>
Send thank you emails to everyone, or at least your host, and follow up with
schools in which you're interested, especially if you have deadlines from other
schools.  
<li>
This is easily one of the top three pieces of job search advice Claire was
given: Collude with other people in your field on the market, if you can.
The departments are colluding; you should too.  You can share details about
the offers, which keeps things in perspective.  Also, it's a really long/tiring
process, so it's nice to have someone to commiserate with.  At first you will
resist, mistakenly believing that you are in competition with these people and
that it is weird.  You are wrong.  There are enough jobs to go around.  Make
friends, it's good for you.
<li>
Golden Rule: only drink at interview dinners if your host(s) is/are drinking
(...and you want to, obviously.  Claire is French, and likes wine with dinner). This is
more difficult if you're female because waiters at nice restaurants typically
ask the lady if she wants something to drink first.
<li>
Silver Rule: never say anything mean about anyone, especially not your current
institution or other institutions at which you are interviewing.  This rule
applies even if your current institution is legitimately dysfunctional.
<li>
This is version 5 of this document. We don't particularly foresee other
versions, but you never know. Every time Wes releases something without a
version system it comes back to haunt him.
