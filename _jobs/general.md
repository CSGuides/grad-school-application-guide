# What Jobs Exist?

Despite the canonical "industry versus academia" phrasing, there are
actually many options available. Below, we introduce several broad job
categories. These categories are meant to help make you aware of options
and are not meant to be definitive. 
*Note that this guide is written from a US perspective, so 
these categories may not be as helpful for non-US 
applicants.*

The term [**R1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States) refers to a doctoral-granting 
institution with very high research activity. 
A [**liberal arts college**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_college) emphasizes undergraduate humanities and
scientific education. In general, liberal arts colleges are private and smaller than larger public state universities. 
(A <i>university</i> has a graduate program and a <i>college</i> does not.)
The term [**tenure**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_tenure) refers to a secure job that cannot easily be terminated,
increasing freedom to pursue your interests. Both large universities and smaller colleges can offer tenured positions
(or not) and both research-focused and teaching-focused positions can be tenured (or not). 


- **US Research Academia**: This includes "top-ten" schools like MIT,
  CMU, Berkeley, Stanford, and Cornell; other R1 schools
  like UC Irvine, Purdue, Rutgers, and Virginia; and schools outside R1, where research is still a component of a tenure track position, but usually modulated by a higher teaching expectation. *Professors often consider 
  this (especially for R1 positions) the default type of application*---even if it may not be where most applicants end up.
  You may benefit from talking to your advisors and mentors about other options. 

- **Industrial Research Labs**: This category includes
  larger research organizations like Microsoft Research, IBM
  Research (T.J. Watson), Google Research,  Meta Research, Intel Labs;
  research organizations that are adjacent to academia, like
  MIT Lincoln Labs, GrammaTech, Kestrel Institute, and Johns Hopkins
  University Applied Physics Laboratories;
  and other
  [Federally Funded 
  Research and Development Centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_funded_research_and_development_centers) (FFRDCs) like Raytheon BBN and MITRE.

- **Industrial "Startups"**: This includes Ph.D.-seeking high-tech
  companies or recently-formed startups. Examples
  include Green Hills, Sourcegraph, Fortify, Nuro and EMC. 
  We don’t have personal experience in this area, but others suggest
  that this work typically involves taking a research idea much further 
  than in academia, from concept to product, with all the steps along 
  the way (e.g., documentation, testing, shipping, marketing). Advice 
  we've received suggests that this can be very rewarding, and "right 
  out of school" is not a bad time to try it.

- **Non-US Academia**: Some institutions are structured
  similar to US universities. Examples include McGill, Toronto,
  Waterloo, and UBC in Canada; EPFL in Switzerland; University College London
  in the UK;
  KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden; 
  and lesser-known places like
  John Cabot University in Italy. These schools operate similarly to US 
  universities with respect to tenure and typically conduct classes in 
  English.

  Other international institutions may follow different structures.
  Examples include ENS in
  France, Oxford in the UK and Tsinghua in China. These schools may not
  conduct classes in English, usually have different promotion and tenure
  schemes, and often have different requirements (e.g., post-docs, 
  second degrees). For example, in the UK, a post-doc is effectively 
  mandatory. Hiring is often localized, so if you’re not already 
  familiar a given institution or location, you may not want to count on 
  them as a job option.

  In both cases, US applicants are sometimes not taken as 
  seriously, as they often decline job offers when given. 
  Apply to these positions only if you are serious about them, to avoid 
  making the process harder for others. 
	<details>
	<summary>Expand for more on applying to Non-US Academia</summary>
  <p>When applying to these institutions, it's important to convey
  why they should take your application seriously. We recommend including a few sentences in your cover letter and research
  statement explicitly stating why you really want to go there (e.g., you speak the local language, have family
  there, or are not tied to the US). Also emphasize these points during 
  phone calls and interviews. For example, <a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Claire</a>'s Francophone 
  background and fluency in French were relevant in Canada, even outside 
  Quebec.</p>
  
  <p>If granted an interview, familiarize yourself with the country's 
  basic political and geographical details (e.g., the name
  of the current prime minister, or all of the provinces of the country 
  in question). If you are offered a position, ask about immigration 
  assistance and support for you and your spouse (if applicable).  
  The school will have experience with these issues and can be quite
  helpful.  It is also legitimate to ask about differences between 
  academic systems.  For example, salaries in Canada are 12-month, not 
  9; tenure is decided
  at 5 years, not 6; and the funding system is almost entirely different as
  compared to the States.</p>
  
  <p>One more word on applying to Canada: Computer Science (CS) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) departments are often 
  interchangeable for Software Engineering applicants. Apply to both, 
  but be aware that relationships between the two departments vary by 
  school. All schools will tell you that they
  get along capitally, especially as compared to all other schools, which are
  plagued by infighting and competition.</p></details>

- **International Industrial Research Labs**:
  This category includes institutions like the 
  CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security (in Germany),
  Max Planck Institutes (in Germany), 
  and the 
  National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (Inria in France).
  These institutions are perhaps more likely to be state-affiliated than US labs,
  but just as with US labs, their finances, and thus the freedom and quality of
  life they afford, wax and wane over time. 
  In addition, we note that a number of larger research organizations, like Google and Microsoft,
  have labs in other countries (e.g., the UK, Canada, China, India, etc.).
  All of the caveats about Non-US US-Like Research Academia apply.

  <a href="https://www.monperrus.net/martin/">Martin Monperrus</a>, Professor of Software Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden
  (and previously at the University of Lille in France, Inria in France, and Darmstadt University
  of Technology in Germany), notes that an important distinction in Europe is between research-only institutions (like CNRS, Inria, Fraunhofer)
  and research-plus-education institutions (universities, like ENS or KTH). In his opinion,
  "the biggest advantage of the latter is that you get much better recruitment channels because you're closer to students".

   
- **Top-Tier Teaching Academia**: This includes places like Carleton,
  Williams, Wesleyan, Oberlin, Bowdoin and Brown. Faculty here still conduct research
  but undergraduate education is emphasized, and the graduate program is smaller or non-existent. 
  Teaching three or more courses per year is common. 

- **Teaching Academia**: This includes smaller liberal arts colleges 
  that may be less well-known outside their local areas, such as 
  Shippensburg, Coe College, 
  Lock Haven, Haverford, Juniata, and Ithaca College. Here 
  the emphasis will be on undergraduate education,
  undergraduate advising and scholarship (to the possible exclusion of the
  constantly-publishing-papers type of research). Teaching six courses a year
  is common, and salaries are generally around half of what you
  would receive from the Research Academia category. 

- **"Instructor" Positions**: Most top-tier schools, including Michigan
  and Virginia, have full-time teaching-focused positions.
  Job titles vary, including "Teaching Professor", "Professor of Practice",
  "Instructor" or "Lecturer". 
  These positions may or may not be tenure-track (and often are not). 
  However, they often have a "social tenure" or "formal expectation of continued 
  employment" at around the six-year mark that mimics tenure. They tend to
  focus on teaching undergraduate "service" courses. 
  In such a position you typically have no
  research requirements but a high teaching requirement.
  <!--If you are interested in one, we recommend you reach out to
  the teaching-focused instructors faculty at your university.-->

- **Standard Industry**: If you want to get a job as a standard
  SWE, your Ph.D. certainly qualifies you. You don't need
  this document in that case. While grad students often aim for more 
  research-oriented roles, these positions are a solid option, 
  particularly if you face a two-body problem. 

- **Post-Docs**: Post-doc positions are still somewhat rare in Computer 
  Science. However, they have become 
  more common in the US, typically following crises, such as the 2008 the financial crisis and 
  also COVID-19, which prompt hiring freezes (and the NSF to sponsor Computing Fellows). It can then be relatively more difficult for fresh PhDs to compete against such emerging postdocs. 
  This is particularly true in some disciplines. For example, anecdotally, post-docs are much more
  common in CS Theory. That said, it is
  still possible (as of 2024) to acquire a tenure-track faculty position in Software Engineering or
  Systems without completing a post-doc first. 
  
  Taking a post-doc can give you time to build your publication record. 
  In addition, post-docs can be helpful
  for non US grad students who eventually want a full-time position in 
  the US On the other hand, if you have taken a post-doc
  people will expect more publications. The general advice is to accept 
  a tenure-track job if you can get one without a post-doc.

  Note that it has also become quite common for graduating PhDs to secure a
  tenure track position and then (request to) defer their start date by a year
  to complete a post-doc. This can allow a new faculty member time to expand
  their research program in tenurable ways without all the demands of a new
  tenure track position. We do not address securing these positions in this
  Guide.

**In this Guide, we focus on the jobs where we have the
most direct experience: US Research Academia, Industrial Research Labs,
Teaching Academia, and "Instructor" positions.**


Ultimately you must decide what sort of positions you will apply for based on your own interests and goals. <span class="highlight">A research position is not inherently "better" or "worse" than a
teaching position---they are made up of different things. Find out what
makes you happy.</span>


# When Should I Apply to Jobs?

If you plan to be interviewing for jobs in the spring of Year X, you 
will submit applications in the fall of Year X-1 (or by mid-January of 
Year X). Deciding where to apply early is crucial because different 
types of institutions have different deadlines.

- **US Research Academia**:  The earliest deadlines are around November 15th, 
  with most applications due in December or early January. 
  Job postings often state when they will "start considering" applications, but 
  many positions accept and review late submissions. 
  It is rare, but not unheard of, for a school to have a hard application
  deadline. For example, [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) was unable to apply to UC Berkeley due to a 
  missed deadline on December 1st. However, she also received a job offer from 
  a school where she applied
  two weeks after the deadline. *We recommend that you read through job postings
  carefully and keep track of deadlines using a spreadsheet.*

- **Industrial Research Labs**: Industry typically conducts rolling interviews, 
  but the main hiring season often aligns with academia (typically with a bit more flexibility). 

- **Industrial "Startups"**: These also generally follow industry's
  more flexible hiring timeline.

- **Non-US Institutions**: For institutions that follow US structures, 
  your applications will typically be due in November, December, or January.
  For others, timelines can vary widely, and may not
  align with the US academic calendar.

  <a href="https://www.monperrus.net/martin/">Martin Monperrus</a>
  notes: "In Europe, applications are not synchronized, even within a country. Some centralized countriess, such as France, may be synchronized. In France, most applications (but not all) are due in February/March, for interviews in May/June."
  He further elaborates that "it's a good practice to do an informal visit to the place before the official deadline. Europe is a small continent. I did a German tour &mdash; five places in five days &mdash; for finding a postdoc."

- **Teaching Academia**: (both Top-Tier and otherwise) These schools often begin interviews up to 
  two months earlier than Research Academia, sometimes as early as October. As 
  a result, your application and letters of recommendation will need to be 
  submitted weeks in advance, with some deadlines as early as late September. 
  *If you plan to apply to these schools, make sure your references are 
  prepared well ahead of time.*

- **"Instructor" Positions**: Depending on the school, these can follow the
  Research or Teaching Academia schedule.

- **Standard Industry**: Rolling deadlines are common, with positions posted 
  throughout the year.

- **Post-Docs**: These positions typically follow the Research Academia 
  calendar, but deadlines may be less strict, as many candidates first search 
  for faculty positions before turning to post-doc opportunities.

Finally, it is common for institutions to "run late" with job postings.
For example, in 2023, the Bowdoin College Computer Science department posted a job
opportunity for an assitant professor position on December 10th
(months later than many other postings for that cycle, and after one of the
authors of this guide had already participated in eight interviews for
similar teaching-focused positions). Applicants
often revisit departmental webpages to see if openings have been posted. 
Such a delay may be caused by various reasons (e.g., getting 
regulatory approval for the posting text, finalizing permission from
a dean or provost, etc.); as long as an official posting is made, you
can feel comfortable applying.
