# Dealing With Rejection

After you have had an interview with a place there are basically only two
reasons for them to reject you:

- They "couldn't build a consensus." Variants on this phrase are common. 
- You were their second or third choice, and one of the candidates they offered
  the job to first, accepted.  

Many of the factors that can lead those situations have nothing to do with you.
For example, research area is often a big concern in hiring. If there's only one
position available, and there was also a really amazing Theory candidate, and
the existing theory faculty won the argument, you may be out of luck, no matter
how great you were.

Additionally, hiring decisions aren't _typically_ decided by a strict majority
vote. A new hire is a big investment of departmental time and energy, especially
since they'll (hopefully) be around for a long time (e.g., with tenure). It's
therefore important that everyone be more or less on board. Perfect agreement
amongst a group of professors is rare-to-unheard-of, but if more than a couple
of people are relatively less enthusiastic (or a couple of people are opposed
outright), no matter the reason, a department is unlikely to be able to make an
offer. 

Rejection can be hard. Try to remember that the fact that you were offered an
interview at all means that at least a few people there think highly of you, and
almost certainly still do.  

You should tread carefully in the time period after your interviews but
before your official offers. Many department chairs have told [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) that they
view it as part of their job (or their responsibility to the department) to 
put the brightest face on this possible and essentially to "string you
along" or "never say no" (and thus keep as many good options for the
department open as possible). Thus a department chair saying "we're still
deliberating" may well mean "we've made a job offer to someone else already
and we're waiting to see how that goes". It has been suggested that
grad students who are naive about the interview process will interpret
"we'll get back to you in a week or two" the wrong way and may thus end up
waiting too long for a job offer that never arrives. In such a case you
should talk to your host or other department members in your area to get 
the inside scoop.

It is my *personal opinion (and experience)* that this isn't really
the case. All of the places that said to me variants of "we're still
interviewing candidates and we'll have our faculty meeting to decide in 2
weeks" ended up making me an offer in 2 weeks -- it wasn't some sort of
smokescreen. Similarly, places that didn't think they were going to be able
to make me an offer (e.g. McGill) told me the rumor early (e.g., "we're
having trouble building consensus, I can't give you any reason to wait for
us") when I asked -- long before they sent an official reject letter. 
This is another case where being more direct or honorable can cost you job offers.
I was willing to deal with people in good faith and assume that they were
not lying to me when they said they would get back to me later. For me it
turned out that they were not lying, but I was willing to take the risk
that they were (and thus that I would wait too long for something that
would never materialize and lose my good offers along the way).  A place
that mentions that they play the "positive spin, never say no" game may
well be dealing intelligently with a harsh economic reality, but you may
not want to work there (cf. office politics).

Similarly, I found that most
schools and chairs were very straightforward with my position on their
"list" and the likelihood of an offer.

I found chairs to be fairly straightforward, especially in light of a
dual-career search.  

While most institutions would notify us together of decisions affecting
the other, I did find that some institutions would
transitively notify one body of another's decision.  That is, I had to hear
from my wife that both our applications were rejected, and vice versa.
