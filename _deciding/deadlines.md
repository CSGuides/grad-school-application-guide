# Deadlines and Hard-Sell Tactics

Official offers will often come with deadlines, especially if you are the
institution's current first choice but they have others "in line" in case you
reject the offer. This can lead to uncomfortable situations where you have to
decide on one offer without knowing about your other potential offers.

It is basically impossible to avoid this by scheduling all of your interviews in
one massive clump. Your interview offers will trickle in at a varying rate, and
even if all of the dates are available for you, not all of
the dates will be available at every university. Moreover, 
the practical limit is about 2.5 interviews per week -- and 2 is much
more reasonable. The travel time and the effort of being "on" for the
entire interview are hard to appreciate until you've actually done it.  [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
only had one 2-interview week, and she strongly encourages you to avoid it.

Another way to cope is to ask for more time. If you explain the situation
honestly, many places will push back their deadlines. For example, Purdue was
willing to push their deadline for [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) back to effectively May 2.
Unfortunately, that can often still not be long enough (it wasn't for [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), as
his timeline indicates).  Waterloo extended [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s decision deadline to give
her the chance to do a second visit at UIUC.  

Finally, certain classes of offers rarely come with deadlines. Industrial
research labs (e.g., IBM and Microsoft) can typically afford to sit on an offer
for as long as you would reasonably like once it has been extended to you.
[Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s Lincoln Labs offer had a basically infinitely-extensible deadline.
Similarly, some academic offers effectively say "you are our first choice and
there is no one we will extend an offer to this year if you turn us down, so
take as long as you like to think about it."

That said, it is reasonable to turn down a position as soon as you know you
are not going to accept it. You don't have to/shouldn't wait until right up
against their deadline "just to be polite."  The sooner they know, the easier it
is for them to make an offer to their next-favorite candidate.

It is my *personal opinion* (as opposed to the rest of this, but this
bit is really an editorial) that any offer with a deadline that you view as too
restrictive should be rejected. I realize that there are economic realities and
that most offers come with eventual deadlines, but you owe it to yourself to
check out all of your options. In essence, an offer that says "you're so
impressive to us that I want you to come here, get tenure, and work with us for
the rest of your life, but I'm not willing to give you another two weeks to get
all of the relevant information and think about things" is saying "I don't want
you to use you brain or it isn't worth it to me to let you use you brain, and I
think that my best shot at hiring you involves pressuring you into a situation
where you will make a snap judgment in my favor." Morality and honor typically
involve restricting your actions for some higher goal and often come with a
price (e.g., deciding not to steal rules out a bunch of actions that could get
you more money, choosing not to lie can make it difficult to explain certain
situations). For me, the price of potentially losing a more lucrative (or
otherwise better-appearing) potential job is one that I am willing to pay in
order to take the "honorable" action of avoiding such hard sell tactics.  In the
end, I wouldn't want to work at a place that didn't want me to take my time and
use my mind when considering where to work.

I feel perhaps slightly less strongly on this issue, though I
never faced the choice of having to turn down one offer without another offer in
hand.  I have been told by various people that this behavior is more common from
and attractive to "lower ranked" schools, because they typically have to work
harder to interview and attract candidates.  Put differently: Stanford can be
reasonably confident that a candidate will accept their offer.
Ranked-75th-University may have to put out more offers to get a bite.  
This is a difficult feature of the job search and I wish schools
could synchronize their schedules a bit more to avoid it; but ultimately, a
system like the medical school "match" process disadvantages applicants (it's an
explicitly legal cartel!), so we may just have to accept that we live in the
best of all possible worlds.
