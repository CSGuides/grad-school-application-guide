# The Waiting Game

You probably submitted your materials in the fall semester. However, for
research-focused roles, you
won't really hear anything from anyone until at least the middle of January when
the faculty can get together and review the applications. Be sure to check your
email during this time, including your spam folder!  At the end of
December 2004, Michigan sent [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) an email saying that there was a mix up with his
application and asking him to resend his letters of recommendation. Unfortunately,
it was sorted to his spam folder and he didn't find it until March, at which
point it was too late. Try to avoid losing potential interviews for reasons not
related to your merits.

While you're waiting you may receive a bunch of emails that say "we
received your application, we're starting a folder for it" or "we have
received all of your letters of recommendation".

Try to resist compulsively checking your website's stats
on where your pageviews are coming from, because it will not make you feel
better, even though it is at least a little bit fascinating.

## Example Timelines

Here are several application timelines (including information about acceptances and rejections): 

{% include timeline.html %}

There are a few things to notice about these otherwise-boring timelines:
- The spread of dates on the <font color="purple">interview
  invitations</font> is wide.  Between [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s first (Jan 11) and last (Apr
  4) there were almost three entire months.  
- Even the spread between an interview invitation and an offer from one
  department can be long (see: [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) and Georgia Tech).  Sometimes you are
  the first of many candidates to interview.  Other times, you are choice #3
  for a department with two slots, and they need to make offers to options #1 and
  #2 first.  It is legitimate to email your host or the chair to let them
  know about your other deadlines.
- Many <font color="green">official offers</font> will require answers before
  you have heard all of your offers, conducted all of your interviews (such as
  Purdue for [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) or NC State or UNM for [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)), or even received all of your
  interview invitations.  CMU called to invite [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) to interview *after she
  had concluded what she thought was her last interview (WUSTL).*  You may be
  forced into the uncomfortable position of rejecting a "known good" offer in
  favor of only the potential of a better offer later.  This can be scary, and if
  you get the one job you really want you should take it, but [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) notes the
  opportunities she would have missed if she'd signed an offer too early.  See
  below on hard-sell tactics.
- Sadly, <font color="red">explicit rejection notices</font> are rare (especially
  without an interview) and are rarely early. Many places just never get back to
  you.  [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) didn't even track which schools that did not interview her
  officially rejected her and when.

I will elide my timeline, as it does
not add much beyond the information already present.  
However, to echo an earlier point: the industrial positions I
applied to did not follow a very neat schedule.  I had to ask to extend an
offer by more than a month to allow for ample time to hear back from
other companies.  The company in question was mostly happy to oblige a
reasonable extension (as I'm told most are), but this is a part of the
process to be aware of, as it can be tedious.  I'd agree with [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s
sentiments that any place that imposes an overly strict deadline may not be
a fun place to work, unless they are in a very advantageous bargaining
position.

I applied during the COVID-19 pandemic.  My timeline differs
substantially in that I generally found it to be more accelerated.  My
phone screens were all Zoom calls and occurred fairly early.  My first
real interview was the first week of January. 

I also applied to both teaching and tenure-track positions to be
flexibile with my wife's concurrent tenure-track search.  All told, we
each interviewed at more than 15 institutions, most of which overlapped.
We received 5 official joint offers, 3 of which were for tenure-track
positions.  We also received 3 more verbal joint tenure-track offers
before ultimately deciding on Vanderbilt.
