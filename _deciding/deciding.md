# Deciding

If you're having a hard time deciding, it's quite legitimate to go on a second
visit (or two).  [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) found these quite informative.  She and her partner went
on such visits together and arranged a "date night" at each one in an effort
to simulate what it might be like to live in the place in question.  As
mentioned, [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s partner also did onsite interviews with companies or otherwise consulted
with department members or others about employment opportunities on such visits.

Talk to everyone. Don't forget to consult yourself. I
can't really help you here generically.

I waited to have complete information for all offers before
making a decision.  I also asked for advice from as many people as possible,
though for the most part this didn't help. I did not choose my position on rank
alone, and it's unlikely that you should.  [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) suggests that I should say more
on this because I ended up at highly-ranked CMU. This decision is mostly
related to what matters to you in life and what makes you happy.  I
sincerely believe that I could have worked and lived happily in all of my
options.  In the end, some combination of department quality and
composition and, very critically, location, led CMU to win the day.  I like
cities, and Pittsburgh is cool, and it is conveniently located for both my
family and my partner's family.  It also has a fairly large tech scene,
allowing my spouse to get a job.  The fact that CMU CS is a highly ranked
department was not irrelevant, but it is not the only reason I accepted the
position.  

I found deciding very difficult.  You will end up connecting, hanging out,
and talking with a large number of people at every school, and it's hard to turn
down new friends.  One aspect of the job decision process that surprised me was
how much time I spent on the phone with faculty at various departments,
discussing their lives.  Unlike negotiation, writing the "turn down the offers"
emails never got any easier.

Talk to everyone, several times.  I
had my mind made up based on my assumptions about both places from which I
had offers.  After talking to [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) a lot, I was contacted by the place I had
decided not to go to and, after two subsequent conversations, I now work
there.  It's impossible to ask all the right questions or get all the
information about any given place, but if you have concerns about a certain
place then talk to them about it.  They should be more than eager to talk to
you about things (if not, that's a bad sign) and you might find that you
made hasty, or even incorrect, assumptions in this difficult, emotional
time.

Having a dual-career situation made this really difficult.  In addition,
all of our interviews were remote during COVID-19, and we only visited one
place in-person.  My advice is to visit places multiple times if
possible (you can also negotiate for extensions on offers if you ask to
visit again in person, though this may be a bigger ask post-COVID). 

We tried to characterize what we wanted both together and
separately. Clear communication is key -- we had to eliminate offers
that were not good for both of us even though they were optimal for one
of us.
