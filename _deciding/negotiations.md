# Salary and Startup Negotiations

At some point, someone will make you an offer. This will include
your nine-month salary and a startup package. 
Your initial contract will probably be for three years, at which point they
will evaluate things and then re-hire you, and then a few years later (usually) you
go up for tenure. The year in which one goes up for tenure 
can vary (e.g., at 5 years in Canada, 9 at CMU, 10 at
Yale/Hopkins, etc.).  Be sure to check.

Everyone knows everyone else and what the going rate is, so if you don't do
anything about it all of your offers within a job category will be
pretty similar. Thus, negotiation. 

## You should negotiate

Negotiating, especially for salary, can feel unsettling.
Graduate students tend to have little
experience with haggling and often find doing so uncomfortable.
Since your new salary will be four or five times
what you are making as a grad student, it may seem like it's not worth
it just for another thousand or two. 
The trick here is that your raises by default will be
cumulative/percentage-based. 
By the laws of compound interest, your starting salary
is critically important over time.

<!-- With one exception, everyone [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) and [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) have talked to was in
favor of haggling on starting salary. Responses were either "I
didn't do it and now I regret it" or "I did it and it didn't work, but you
should try it" or "I did it and it worked and I'm glad". -->

Negotiation is also standard. The Dean/Department Head/whomever you're interacting with
expect it and will be neither surprised nor offended.  With respect
to startup packages, it may help to realize that opening offers
are typically standardized in a given year for a given department. Meanwhile, startup
needs vary _wildly_. Some faculty require specialized equipment, lab
space, or travel funds to visit remote study sites. Offers aren't typically
adjusted for this a priori, instead
starting at some "reasonable" baseline, with negotiation expected.

No one will think
less of you for negotiating, unless (I suspect) you're "unreasonable" or rude.  I will
claim that I did my best to be fair and make reasonable requests and to do
so politely.  I have been told that my requests to at least one school were
"all reasonable, professional, and polite." I have also been told that this
is not always the case: "some hires send seven pages of detailed demands."
I don't know what the line is between reasonable and unreasonable, nor if I
succeeded at staying on the correct side of it in all cases, but I
certainly made a good-faith effort.

I feel more strongly about all this---that negotiating is standard, and you should
do it---now, a decade later, having been on the other side.  If nothing else, competent hiring entities
will _never_ open with their best possible offer.

## How to negotiate

Note 1: remember that although you conduct this
process with the department chair (or hiring manager or whatnot) who sent
you the official offer, *it doesn't hurt them and they are not really
involved*. If you ask for another $5k, you're not taking $5k out of the chair's
salary or (usually) even their budget. The chair will typically convey your request to the dean,
and typically argue for it. The dean will come back with
something and the chair will relay that you. Do not adopt a zero-sum
mentality -- you'll hamstring yourself. In industry the situation is
even more clear-cut -- you're not negotiating with your manager, you're
often negotiating with someone in HR or Accounting or somesuch. 

Note 2: it is incredibly helpful to get offer details in writing.  Departments
can be a bit reticent. Sometimes it really is
a bureaucratic timesink to have to issue a revised formal offer mid-negotiation;
sometimes the person on the other end would simply be happier if you didn't have a
formal offer to wave at another institution. Try
to get details over email, and politely nudge your counterparts for official
documentation, as much as possible.

### Salary

_The [Taulbee Survey](https://cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey/)
is a great resource for market rates over time._

They've given you an offer with a starting salary of X. How do
you ask for more?

**The competing offer**: This is the easiest approach.  If you have a higher
offer from another comparable place, they will probably at least _try_
to match it (this isn't a guarantee -- [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s
UMass offer was not matched by NYU, for example). Even if the higher number
cannot be fully matched, a school will often increase starting salary by
some amount in response. This works less well between schools that are far apart
in the rankings, or in places with very divergent
costs of living. You may have to send them a copy of the other offer to
show the dean.

**Cost of living**: Schools in big expensive cities may well
have factored this into their opening offer, but you can ask anyway. 
Schools will sometimes make cost-of-living arguments to
justify relatively lower salaries --- you can counter this with your own
research. You may be surprised --- housing can be more expensive in smaller towns like
Charlottesville than mid-sized cities like Pittsburgh. 

**Just ask**: Mention that you think the salary is low or that (you'll never do
this, but hey) you're a strong researcher with a promising research career
coming from Berkeley with a better-than-respectable resume and that you think
you're worth a bit more.

Evaluate benefits, especially health care, along with salary offers.  One of the
offers [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) received included a fairly high salary compared to her other
offers, but provided notably expensive health insurance that largely
counteracted the salary advantage.  You can mention
this type of issue in negotiation conversations.

Regardless, you never want to turn things into an "or-else" or "ultimatum"
situation. Phrasing is key: "your offer is not the most attractive offer
available to me" rather than "give me more or I'm leaving." The fact that
they made you an offer means that they want you; they're sort of on your side.  


It's also valid to ask to what
extent the salary is negotiable. In many places (e.g., Berkeley, Microsoft)
you obtain permission to hire someone at a certain "level" or "rank" or
"band" and that strictly limits the starting salary range. 
[Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) found that there was wide variability in the flexibility that schools had
regarding salaries, especially between state schools.  In her experience,
state and public schools are free and open with the details of their offers
with everyone, because their salaries are typically public knowledge.
Department chairs at private schools often keep such details very close to
the vest.

### Startup package

The idea behind a startup package for tenure track positions is to help a new
faculty member bootstrap their labs to success over the first 2--3 years, giving them time to
independently raise money via grants.
The startup package should therefore
include money for graduate students (two students for two years each is
typical), travel, equipment, and some way to cover your Summer salary for the
first year or two. It should also include discretionary funds.  Offers
sometimes fold some-to-all of the useful startup categories (travel, equipment,
summer salary) into discretionary. 

You'll probably find
it easier to change your startup package than your salary. You can try to ask for more
students, more discretionary funding, or for some-to-all of the startup package to
be discretionary (e.g., "I will be able to live with the amount of money
you're offering me if you allow me to spend it any way I like"). 

This is easier if you can justify your request(s).  For example, [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) blocked
out some travel plans (for some reason, SE conferences in 2013-2015 were all in
far-flung locations) and
detailed computing equipment. When negotiating, [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) provided 
universities with a detailed spreadsheet outlining her desired startup budget. This budget 
included line items for travel and research group morale activities, such as lab lunches. The largest 
part of her budget related to equipment that she needed for her research. Depending on the school, she requested funding for a 
combination of an eye-tracker, an fNIRS machine (a neuroimaging device), and several Apple Vision Pros. The specific combination 
varied based on the existing resources at each school. For instance, at one university, she requested a smaller 
fNIRS machine designed to integrate with an existing one, allowing her to focus the negotiation on other aspects of her budget.

**We recommend that if you are negotiating with universities for equipment, you first inquire about the equipment the 
institution already possesses.** This will allow you to justify the necessity of new equipment and 
explain how it will complement the department’s existing resources. *For large purchases 
(e.g. [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)’s fNIRs machine), we also recommend that you reach 
out to a company representative to get an exact quote that you can forward to departments.* Overall, 
[Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)  was able to more than double allotted equipment or 
discretionary funds at multiple universities.

Beyond equipment, we also recommend that you
ask about: (1) the degree to which TAing can cover a
student cost, and policies/norms (e.g., do all first year students typically
TA? Does that render them free to their advisor?), (2) department policies on faculty/student
equipment, (3) the computing facilities, and
what kinds of availability guarantees they provide, and (4) whether costs such as IT
support, compute time, or printing are charged to faculty funds.   Some departments replace faculty and student computers
every couple of years out of a dedicated fund.  In others, all such replacements
come from faculty budgets.  By the way,
everyone will tell you that they have state-of-the-art computing facilities that
will meet your needs perfectly.  Your goal is to identify exactly what you need
to make sure that it's actually available.  It's a good time to plan to get a beefy
compute server, or ensure that your equipment funds can be spent on,
e.g., EC2. 

Find out when your startup funds expire. You can ask to push that date out. In addition, make sure (in writing)
that your grad student funding includes the summer months. A friend of [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s ended up in
a situation where he "took their word" that it did, 
and they came back to him later and made a fuss because it wasn't written in the
contract.  This advice ("get it in writing") applies to basically everything,
perhaps especially anything about lab space, and the teaching leave you can expect as a new hire.

On the subject of Canada: you can definitely negotiate with Canadian schools
just as much (if not more so, in some cases) as you can with US schools.  Note,
however, that offers from Canada are basically incomparable in every way to
offers from the US, because their funding system is completely different, so
comparative negotiation is hard.  Note also that Canadian schools are especially
careful about avoiding salary inversion, but that, like the vast majority of US
state schools, their salary information is public.  Look it up for your
negotiation purposes.

## Results

By some combination of these approaches (considering and comparing across all
offers) [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) was able to increase his (lowest) starting salary by 3.6% and double
his (lowest) startup funds. [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) did not track her "haggling success" in this
way, but she negotiated at least a little bit with every department that
made an offer on both salary and startup, and in all cases was met *at
least* in the middle on at least some portion of her requests.  

Industrial salaries are effectively incomprable to academic salaries and
departments will usually be unwilling to discuss matching them, though may
raise a starting salary a bit in response to such a competing offer.
Note that raises in industry are much more common, as is job switching, and jobs
often include bonuses and equity. 

**Company Trivia**: Friends of [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s at IBM have suggested that 
you should ask for another $10,000 right off the
bat (and that they'll do it without blinking). If for some
reason you can't bring yourself to do that that it would be "criminal" not
to ask for $5,000. However, multiple data points at Microsoft Research
suggest that it is very difficult to haggle for starting salaries there
because of internal strictures; the same goes for Google. [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) only knows of one success story haggling
at Microsoft, and [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) has never heard of anyone succeed at Google.

{% capture quote %}
In the interest of full disclosure,
I didn't ask for a higher salary at all schools. Whether I did or not
depended on the offer, especially as compared to my other offers.  I did
negotiate with every department that made me an offer, however, at least on
startup.  Honestly, I found negotiating very difficult.  However, it grew
easier with practice.  The first couple of negotiation emails I wrote took
me hours to compose and send.  By contrast, for my final set of
negotiations, I initiated the conversation on the phone with the department
chair during the "initial offer" conversation.

Finally, if you think you want to haggle but you need more advice about it,
email your local department head (or past department heads). They have
probably seen it many times from both sides of the fence and are often
willing to give advice (it worked for [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)).
