# Introduction

<span class="highlight">*Are you a current undergraduate student? Do you already have an undergraduate degree? Are you curious about graduate school or thinking about applying to a graduate program for a computing-related Master’s degree or a PhD?*</span>

**If so, this site is for you!**

This website offers a summary of experiences, insights, and advice—including many personal opinions and accounts—on navigating the graduate school application process for computer science. It contains both general advice as well as detailed accounts of several applications, including:

* Applications from students with self-perceived “low” GPAs  
* Applications from students with less-traditional academic paths (e.g., longer undergraduate programs, gap time outside of academia after undergraduate programs)  
* Applications from students who self-perceived that few professors would recommend them  
* Applications from students who were the first in their families to apply  
* Applications from students without published undergraduate research  
* Applications from students with non-standard or limited research experience  

**These students were all admitted** to Computer Science graduate programs across a broad spectrum of selectivity.

**This website is structured as a how-to guide for graduate applications.**  
We provide collective advice, quotes and commentary from a few individuals (including both applicants and also professors who have collectively reviewed hundreds of graduate applications), and application materials (including essays) from many individuals. 
 


# What is Graduate School?

The term *“graduate school”* (or *“graduate program”* or *“post-graduate degree”*, etc.) can mean different things. In this guide, we focus on two graduate degree tracks:

## Master’s Degree

This is the most common graduate degree. It typically takes **1–2 years** to complete and has a significant coursework focus. You typically pay tuition if you are a master’s degree student.  

Five-year combined bachelor’s + master’s programs from the same institution are common. Smaller schools might also have an articulation agreement with a larger university to offer a **3+2** (three years at school X, then two years at school Y) or **4+1** program.

A master’s degree can have a research or thesis component, but that is rarer. Master’s degrees are typically funded primarily by the student (you). Students are sometimes paid to be teaching assistants or funded through their jobs, but this is rarer. A master’s degree can have various names (MS, MEng, MSc, etc.).

A primary admission consideration is **your ability to succeed at rigorous, graduate-level coursework.**

Some schools offer online master’s degree programs. Georgia Tech’s accredited online master’s program is a good example.

## Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)

This graduate degree is less common. A PhD always has a **research component.** PhD students work under the direction of advisors; that relationship is critical to graduate success.

In the U.S., students typically pursue a master’s degree “along the way” while completing a PhD. While some applicants already have master’s degrees, it is **not required** to apply to a PhD program. A student in a PhD program often obtains a master’s degree around the two-year mark and then spends another four years completing the PhD—for a total of about six years.

Engineering PhD students are typically **fully funded**: tuition, health insurance, and a stipend are covered.

PhD students are usually paid as teaching assistants or research assistants. They can also run classes as instructors of record, but that is rarer in computer science.

A primary admission consideration is **your ability to carry out rigorous research.**

In this guide, we use terms like “PhD student” to refer to someone in the PhD track, even if that person is currently getting a master’s degree along the way.

---

A university typically offers both a master’s and PhD track within its graduate program. Applications are usually due for both at the same time (often around **December** of the year before you start).  

If you are earlier in your undergraduate degree, or are a returning adult or non-traditional student, this guide can help you take actions to improve your admissions chances. If you are in your final year, you’ll have to decide whether to apply for the master’s or PhD track. *This guide will help you with those decisions and applications!*

# Reading This Guide & Individual Perspectives
The technical content of this guide was written by computer science professors. The primary authors are **Wes Weimer** (tenured full professor at the University of Michigan) and **Madeline Endres** (tenure-track assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst).  

However, many others contributed directly, including by double-checking this information and adding insights.

In addition, multiple graduate students contributed their own experiences, stories and application materials. We often refer to specific contributors by name in this guide. 

Contributor opinions, comments and experiences appear adjacent to the main text in highlighted and offset quotations. We believe that a combination of both perspectives (e.g., both “I am a professor, let me tell you how professors decide which students to admit into graduate programs” and also “I am a student, let me tell you what it is like to be a student day-to-day”) will give readers the most complete picture. 

Finally, this guide focuses on common or average experiences for a broad audience. We may include qualifiers such as “usually” or “commonly” or “typically” in the text, but sometimes omit them for prose clarity. For example, almost every PhD student is paid to do research work throughout the program. While there are a few master’s degree track students who are paid to do research, it is rare and you shouldn’t count on it when you apply, calculate costs, and make future plans.


# Applying to a Master’s Degree Program – Overview

This guide includes entire sections on major activities, such as writing your application essays, finding letter writers, and interviewing. Here we provide a quick overview for master’s degree applications:

1. **Early Undergrad.** I If you can, in the year(s) before you apply, take actions that will strengthen your application.
See the later sections for how your application will be evaluated. 
Don’t panic: you’re still fine if you’re first thinking about this in your senior year! 


2. **Undergraduate Research (Optional).** Undergraduate research can help with a master’s program application, but it’s not required. Most admitted master’s degree students have no published research. 

3. **Letters of Recommendation.**  Identify one primary letter writer and two secondary letter writers. 
You should aim to lock them in by October. 

4. **Identify Schools.** On average, students apply to **12–16 schools.** You may have special constraints or considerations (e.g., “I want to stay in the area, so I will apply for my local five-year bachelor’s + master’s program, but if I don’t get in, I’ll get a job in industry”). 

5. **Skip the GREs.** Most programs no longer require or use GRE scores. Only take them if a specific program demands it.

6. **Work on Application Materials.** Aside from small variations, most master’s programs ask for the same materials. These typically include a resume/CV, transcript, and statement of purpose. We recommend starting your statement of purpose several weeks in advance, and asking multiple mentors and peers for feedback.

7. **Deadlines.** Your applications will be due by December 15th at the latest. Many are due earlier. 
Some schools say they accept master’s program applications at any time, but graduate admissions committees primarily review applications once per year. 
Many schools offer fee waivers. You should apply for them if you are eligible. Schools typically fund them at a very, very high rate. 
If you are a student applying to a graduate program, your current institution might also have funds available to help cover application fees.

8. **Fee Waivers.** Many schools offer them—apply if eligible. Your current institution may also provide funds.

9. **Submission.** Leave two weekends to submit the applications via online portals. This activity is very draining.

10. **Contingency Planning.** Make a plan for what to do if things don’t work out. What will you do over the summer? 

If you’re applying for a master’s degree program, you are in good company! The vast majority of graduate degrees awarded are master’s degrees. For example, from Fall 2022 to Winter 2024, the University of Michigan CSE program awarded “only” 34 PhD degrees, and in that same period it awarded 277 master’s degrees (see “Graduate Degree Completion” in their [Annual Transparency Report](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/CSE-Climate-Report-2023-2024.pdf).

# Applying to a PhD Program – Overview

This guide also includes full sections on essays, letters, and interviews. Here’s a brief overview for PhD track applications:

1. **Undergraduate Research or Project.**  Unlike a master’s degree application, a PhD application really benefits from undergraduate research experience. It does not need to be published, but you should aim for it.

2. **Early Undergrad Preparation.** If you can, in the year(s) before you apply, take other actions that will strengthen your application. Activities include (but are not limited to; see FIXME in this guide for details):
Actively engage in your classes by participating in discussions, asking questions, and achieving the highest grades within your abilities
Interview to serve as a teaching assistant
Attend or present at undergraduate conferences and/or special interest conferences (e.g., Grace Hopper)
Meet with your professors and advisors to discuss career and research opportunities
Apply for summer opportunities, such as research fellowships or REUs (Research Experiences for Undergraduates)

3. **Letters of Recommendation.**  Identify one primary letter writer and two secondary letter writers. A strong, positive letter of recommendation presenting evidence of your ability to conduct research (or other PhD-relevant activities) is one the most important aspects of your application. 
You should aim to lock them in by October.

4. **Identify Schools.** On average, students apply to **12–16 programs.**

5. **Skip the GREs.** Same as with master’s—most schools have dropped them.

6. **Application Materials.** Aside from small variations, most master’s programs ask for the same materials. These typically include a resume/CV, transcript, and statement of purpose. We recommend starting your statement of purpose several weeks in advance, and asking multiple mentors and peers for feedback.

7. **Deadlines.** Your applications will be due by December 15th at the latest. 
Many schools offer fee waivers. You should apply for them if you are eligible. Schools typically fund them at a very, very high rate. 
If you are a student applying to a graduate program, your current institution might also have funds available to help cover application fees.

8. **Fee Waivers.** Apply for them; they’re commonly granted.

9. **Submission.** Leave two weekends for submitting applications.

10. **Contingency Planning.** Make a plan for what to do if things don’t work out. What will you do over the summer?
