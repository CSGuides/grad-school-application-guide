# Introduction

<span class="highlight">*Are you a current undergraduate student? Do you already have an undergraduate degree? Are you curious about graduate school or thinking about applying to a graduate program for a computing-related Master’s degree or a PhD?*</span>

**If so, this site is for you!**

This website offers a *summary of experiences, insights, and advice*—including many personal opinions and accounts—*on navigating the graduate school application process for computer science.* It contains both general advice as well as detailed accounts of several applications, including:

* Applications from students with self-perceived “low” GPAs  
* Applications from students with less-traditional academic paths (e.g., longer undergraduate programs, gap time outside of academia after undergraduate programs)  
* Applications from students who self-perceived that few professors would recommend them  
* Applications from students who were the first in their families to apply  
* Applications from students without published undergraduate research  
* Applications from students with non-standard or limited research experience  

**These students were all admitted** to Computer Science graduate programs across a broad spectrum of selectivity.

**This website is structured as a how-to guide for graduate applications.**  
We provide collective advice, quotes and commentary from a few individuals (including both applicants and professors who have collectively reviewed hundreds of graduate applications), and application materials (including essays) from many individuals.

# What is Graduate School?

The term *“graduate school”* (or *“graduate program”* or *“post-graduate degree”*, etc.) can mean different things. In this guide, we focus on two graduate degree tracks:

## Master’s Degree

This is the most common graduate degree. It typically takes **1–2 years** to complete and has a significant coursework focus. You typically pay tuition if you are a master’s degree student.  

Five-year combined bachelor’s + master’s programs from the same institution are common. Smaller schools might also have an articulation agreement with a larger university to offer a **3+2** (three years at school X, then two years at school Y) or **4+1** program.

A master’s degree can have a research or thesis component, but that is rarer. Master’s degrees are typically funded primarily by the student (you). Students are sometimes paid to be teaching assistants or funded through their jobs, but this is rarer. A master’s degree can have various names (MS, MEng, MSc, etc.).

A primary admission consideration is **your ability to succeed at rigorous, graduate-level coursework.**

Some schools offer online master’s degree programs. Georgia Tech’s accredited online master’s program is a good example.

## Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)

This graduate degree is less common. A PhD always has a **research component.** PhD students work under the direction of advisors; that relationship is critical to graduate success.

In the U.S., students typically pursue a master’s degree “along the way” while completing a PhD. While some applicants already have master’s degrees, it is **not required** to apply to a PhD program. A student in a PhD program often obtains a master’s degree around the two-year mark and then spends another four years completing the PhD—for a total of about six years.

Engineering PhD students are typically **fully funded**: tuition, health insurance, and a stipend are covered.

PhD students are usually paid as teaching assistants or research assistants. They can also run classes as instructors of record, but that is rarer in computer science.

A primary admission consideration is **your ability to carry out rigorous research.**

In this guide, we use terms like “PhD student” to refer to someone in the PhD track, even if that person is currently getting a master’s degree along the way.

---

A university typically offers both a master’s and PhD track within its graduate program. Applications are usually due for both at the same time (often around **December** of the year before you start).  

If you are earlier in your undergraduate degree, or are a returning adult or non-traditional student, this guide can help you take actions to improve your admissions chances. If you are in your final year, you’ll have to decide whether to apply for the master’s or PhD track. *This guide will help you with those decisions and applications!*

# Reading This Guide & Individual Perspectives

The technical content of this guide was written by computer science professors. The primary authors are **Wes Weimer** (University of Michigan) and **Madeline Endres** (University of Massachusetts Amherst).  

However, many others contributed directly, including by double-checking this information and adding insights.

Multiple graduate students also contributed their experiences, stories, and application materials. We often refer to specific contributors by name in this guide.

Contributor opinions, comments, and experiences appear adjacent to the main text in highlighted quotations. We believe that a combination of both perspectives—  
<span class="highlight">*“I am a professor, let me tell you how professors decide which students to admit.”*</span> and  
<span class="highlight">*“I am a student, let me tell you what it’s like to be a student day-to-day.”*</span>  
—will give readers the most complete picture.

Finally, this guide focuses on *common or average experiences* for a broad audience. We sometimes omit qualifiers like “usually” or “typically” for clarity. For example, almost every PhD student is paid to do research work throughout the program. While a few master’s students are paid to do research, it’s rare—so you shouldn’t count on it when you apply, calculate costs, and make plans.

# Applying to a Master’s Degree Program – Overview

This guide includes sections on major activities such as writing essays, finding letter writers, and interviewing. Here is a quick overview for master’s applications:

1. **Early Undergrad.** If you can, take actions that will strengthen your application. See later sections for evaluation details.  
   Don’t panic—if you’re first thinking about this in your senior year, you’re still fine!

2. **Undergraduate Research (Optional).** Research can help but is *not required.* Most admitted master’s students have no published research.

3. **Letters of Recommendation.** Identify one primary and two secondary letter writers.  
   Aim to lock them in by **October.**

4. **Identify Schools.** On average, students apply to **12–16 schools.**

5. **Skip the GREs.** Most programs no longer require or use GRE scores. Only take them if a specific program demands it.

6. **Work on Application Materials.** Most programs ask for a résumé/CV, transcript, and statement of purpose.  
   Start your statement early and get feedback from mentors and peers.

7. **Deadlines.** Most are due by **December 15th**, some earlier.  
   Even programs that say “rolling admission” often review only once per year.

8. **Fee Waivers.** Many schools offer them—apply if eligible. Your current institution may also provide funds.

9. **Submission.** Leave **two weekends** to submit via portals; it’s surprisingly draining.

10. **Contingency Planning.** Plan what to do if things don’t work out—e.g., summer options or reapplications.

<span class="highlight">From Fall 2022 to Winter 2024, the University of Michigan CSE program awarded 34 PhDs and 277 Master’s degrees.</span>  
Master’s degrees make up the vast majority of graduate degrees awarded.

# Applying to a PhD Program – Overview

This guide also includes full sections on essays, letters, and interviews. Here’s a brief overview for PhD track applications:

1. **Undergraduate Research or Project.** Unlike a master’s application, PhD applications *really benefit* from research experience. It doesn’t need to be published but should demonstrate research potential.

2. **Early Undergrad Preparation.** Engage in classes, serve as a TA, attend undergraduate conferences (e.g., Grace Hopper), and meet with professors to discuss research opportunities.  
   Apply for REUs (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) or similar summer fellowships.

3. **Letters of Recommendation.** Identify one primary and two secondary writers. Strong, specific letters about your research ability are *crucial.*  
   Aim to lock them in by **October.**

4. **Identify Schools.** On average, students apply to **12–16 programs.**

5. **Skip the GREs.** Same as with master’s—most schools have dropped them.

6. **Application Materials.** Include a résumé/CV, transcript, and statement of purpose. Start early and get multiple rounds of feedback.

7. **Deadlines.** Usually **December 15th** or earlier.

8. **Fee Waivers.** Apply for them; they’re commonly granted.

9. **Submission.** Leave two weekends for submitting applications.

10. **Contingency Planning.** Plan ahead for alternate paths if you’re not admitted this cycle.
