# Introduction

<span class="highlight">*Are you currently in graduate school, and are you considering applying (or currently looking) for a post-graduate position in computer science?*</span> 

**If so, this site is for you!**

This website offers a *summary of experiences, insights, and advice*---including many personal opinions and accounts---*on navigating the job search process for computer science academia and industrial research labs*. It contains both general advice as well as detailed accounts of several job searches, including:

* Multiple searches resulting in job offers at top-tier academic research institutions (e.g.,
  CMU, UMass Amherst, etc.).
* Multiple searches resulting in job offers in industrial research (e.g.,
  GrammaTech, Lincoln Labs, etc.).
* Multiple searches resulting in job offers at liberal arts colleges (e.g.,
  Harvey Mudd, St. Lawrence, etc.).

**This website is structured as a how-to guide for graduate students.**
We provide collective advice, quote and commentary from a few individuals, and application materials from many individuals. 
We sometimes refer to [specific authors by name](about.md).

# Is This Guide For Me?

<span class="highlight">If you are in graduate school and either on the job market or planning to apply for CS-related jobs, this guide is for you.</span>

However, **this guide isn't just for students currently on the job market!** Even if 
you are are just starting graduate school, the sections on [finding job opportunities](jobs.md)
and [application preparation](applying.md) can still be helpful. Your career
goals will often inform the choices you make during your doctoral studies, making it important to
be aware of the kinds of jobs available to you and what those jobs may value.  

It's also helpful to know what goes into an application package so you can plan ahead.
For example, if you're aiming for an academic career that emphasizes
teaching, you might plan for being a primary instructor ("instructor of
record" at some institutions) while still a doctoral student. Conversely, if
you are most interested in a research-focused career, you might instead choose
to bolster your resume with industrial internships.  <span class="highlight">*It's much better to know 
what to expect and plan ahead than to regret not doing something.*</span>

# Navigating This Guide

This guide is organized around four major stages of a job search:

  1. [Finding jobs](jobs.md)
  2. [Preparing your application](applying.md)
  3. [Interviewing](interviewing.md)
  4. [Deciding between offers](deciding.md) 

This guide also contains 
[<span class="highlight-link">example application materials and interview resources</span>](exampleMaterials.md) 
that were actually used in real job searches.
These materials are tailored for different job types, including Research Tenure-Track positions 
(sometimes abbreviated "R1 TT"), 
Research Teaching-Focused positions, Liberal Arts Tenure-Track positions, and Industrial Research positions.

We next briefly summarize each phase.

## Phase 1: [Finding Jobs](jobs.md)

* <span class="student-q">"What types of jobs exist after CS graduate school?"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"What can I do in graduate school to prepare for the job I want?"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"How can I find jobs to apply to?"</span>

As you begin your search, a first step is to think about the types of jobs
that appeal to you.  We discuss various job opportunities in computer science
for students earning doctoral degrees.  Then we give pointers for discovering
open searches and how to interpret job postings.

## Phase 2: [Preparing Your Application](applying.md)

* <span class="student-q">"What do I need to apply to CS graduate jobs?"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"How should I write my application materials?"</span>

Applications are reasonably uniform across academic institutions, and many aspects
of an academic application apply to industrial research as well.  We provide 
high-level guidance to help you start crafting your application materials, along with 
concrete examples from successful job searches.

## Phase 3: [Interviewing](interviewing.md)

* <span class="student-q">"When will I hear back from my applications?"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"What does an academic interview look like?"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"How should I structure my job talk?"</span>

We discuss common activities for interviews and give tips on preparing for 
questions---both those youâ€™ll need to answer and those you might want to ask.

## Phase 4: [Making a Decision](deciding.md)

* <span class="student-q">"Which job should I choose?!"</span>

* <span class="student-q">"How can I negotiate my offer?"</span>

When you reach the stage of considering job offers, it's time to make a decision.
This process can be daunting, and it can be difficult to weigh different factors.
We provide guidance on managing overlapping deadlines and negotiating your salary and
startup. We also offer words of encouragement as you consider which offer to
accept.

# [Examples of Successful Materials](exampleMaterials.md)

Successful applicants from past cycles have generously agreed to provide their
job search materials. These include 
CVs, Cover Letters, Research Statements, Teaching Statements, Diversity Statements, Job 
Talk Slides, and Application Timelines (including Rejections and Acceptances). 
The portfolios are searchable by tags (e.g., 
job type, research area, dual career search, etc.). *These examples offer practical guidance
as you develop your own application.*

<span class="highlight">The job search can definitely be challenging! It can be helpful to 
remember that every successful applicant was once in your position. We hope this Guide 
helps you better navigate each stage of the cycle.</span>
