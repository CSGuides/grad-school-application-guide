# What Happens After You Apply

Once you’ve submitted your graduate school applications, the waiting begins.  In most cases, you’ll start to hear back from programs between **January and March**.  Some schools will send direct offers of admission, while others will invite you to participate in an **interview** or **visit day** before making a final decision.

These conversations are your opportunity to learn more about the program and for faculty to assess your fit for their department or research group.  <span class="highlight">Think of this stage as a two-way process: the graduate school is evaluating you, but you are also evaluating them.</span>

In this section, we’ll cover what to expect during interviews and visit days, including how to prepare and what kinds of questions you might be asked, and how to decide between offers.
