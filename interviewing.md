# The Interview Process: What to Expect

Now that you've submitted your application, the waiting begins...

Many jobs will start by reaching out for a *phone screening* to assess whether you're a good 
fit for the job. If you pass the screening, you may be invited for an in-person 
interview. While there is some variation by job type, 
<span class="highlight">graduate-level job interviews 
typically last 1-2 days and consist of a job talk (or teaching talk), 
individual interviews, and a group dinner.</span>

In the rest of this tab, we'll cover what to expect during the interview process, 
including [phone screenings](#phone-screening), the [typical interview schedule](#interview-visit-overview), 
and tips on how to structure your [job talk](#preparing-your-job-talk) or [teaching talk](#preparing-your-teaching-talk). We'll also provide specific 
advice for [individual interviews](#individual-meeting-questions), and tips on
navigating [dual career situations](#dual-career-couples).

Before any phone screening or interview, 
we recommend visiting the faculty web page and finding people
with interests similar to your own, as well as looking up people who
are on your schedule.
