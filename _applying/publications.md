# Selecting Indicative Publications

Some schools will ask for you to submit up to three indicative publications.
As discussed earlier, most interviewers will go to your website first to look
at your materials. As a result, the specific publications that you choose
to include in your application may not be too important. 

However, it is worth being a little strategic. We recommend picking publications 
that are published in higher-tier venues and align with how you are positioning
yourself on the job market. For example, if you are aiming for Software Engineering
positions, you might want to focus on publications from venues
like the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) or Transactions
on Software Engineering (TSE) that you plan to focus on in your job talk.
We recommend that you include at least one first-authored paper. However,
not all of them need to be first-authored (at least if you are in PL or SE).
