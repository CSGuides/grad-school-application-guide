# Cover Letters

Getting a cover letter wrong can have significant consequences. A
poorly crafted cover letter can lead to your entire application being misfiled
or overlooked.

[Claire Le Goues](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), who was Chair of the S3D Tenure Track Hiring Committee at CMU
from 2019 to 2022, has learned that cover letters are much more important now
than they were in prior decades. She suggests that applicants not treat cover
letters as an afterthought. 

Your cover letter should be brief and to the point. It should: 

1. Quickly introduce who you are (e.g., name, current institution and title).
2. Specify the job you are applying for (including any reference numbers).
3. Give a high-level overview of your research focus.  
4. Indicate why you are excited about the position, why you are a good fit,
  and why you are likely to accept an offer. 
5. Mention any special circumstances (e.g., two-body problem).

Limit the overview of your research focus to a paragraph or two; 
your [research statement](#research-statement) is the place for detail. 
This is particularly important when applying to large schools 
that may have many independent
searches but only one application portal. If you find it difficult to
summarize, [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) recommends prioritizing outcomes (e.g., awards) over
lower-level mechanisms (e.g., mentioning that you use a particular
type of dataflow analysis). **Make it easy for a hiring chair in
your area to quickly realize you're one of theirs!**

If a portal asks you to select research area keywords, it is to your
advantage to be accurate. At many institutions, different groups of faculty will
read different applications: for example, architecture faculty may read 
and evaluate architecture applications. If you are an architecture candidate
who has one theory publication, checking both the architecture and theory boxes runs the risk that your
application will be evaluated by theory professors, who may or may not know if
ASPLOS and MICRO are good venues. This issue can be difficult to navigate for
interdisciplinary applicants, and we recommend talking to your advisor about how to position yourself
and using other mechanisms available to you (such as your cover letter and research statement) to
further clarify your expertise. 

Reasons you are excited about the position can include the type of
school (public vs. private, R1 vs. liberal arts), the location, 
specific initiatives or centers related to your research, and
past collaborations you've had with faculty at the institution. 
**If someone on the inside told you to apply, be sure to mention it 
in your cover letter.**

[Kevin Leach](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) notes that he prepared a generalized cover letter and then changed
sentences to specialize it to each department, such as by listing faculty he knew. [Kevin Angstadt](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
notes that teaching-focused and research-focused positions may merit different cover letter contents.

I was wrong to treat cover letters as unimportant when I was on the market.  Especially for applicants to
large departments/schools, they're critical to helping hiring committees
identify candidates relevant to a particular search focus, and ensure
materials are read by people with expertise. 

That said, seriously, please don't go crazy with the detail: make it easy for me to
skim and quickly/accurately figure out your research area.
