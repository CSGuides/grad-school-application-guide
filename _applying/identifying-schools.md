# Identifying Schools

If you are applying, getting into one or more graduate programs is **“infinitely” better than getting into zero.** To mitigate the risk, we recommend applying to many programs and applying to a **broad range of programs** (i.e., programs of varying selectivity).  

To see why, suppose, for simplicity, that every school independently has a 10% chance of accepting your application. (See historical Michigan numbers above for comparison; the advice here is primarily drawn from US schools.) If you apply to “only” five programs, there is a (100% - 10%)^5 = 59% chance that the biased coin comes up “tails” each time and you are rejected by all programs. So we want to apply to many programs.  

However, even applying to 15 programs with 10% acceptance rates still leaves a 20% chance of being rejected by all of them, so we also recommend applying to programs with a range of selectivities. This usually takes the form of ~10 schools in a band, 1–2 *aspirational* schools (long-shot selective schools that would be great, but may not accept you) and 3–4 *safety* schools (less-selective schools that are more likely to accept you).  

Students we work with typically apply to **12–16 programs.** If you apply to more than 16 programs, you run the risk of failing to secure letter writers or offending your letter writers. While letters of recommendation are primarily shared between institutions, letter writers often specialize them to particular schools, and so it is an increasing imposition to ask them to write too many letters.  

In general, graduate programs have become increasingly selective in recent years: few applicants are admitted. For example, the Michigan historical data (see FIXME in this guide) shows master’s degree admission dropping from 15% to 5% from 2014 to 2024 and PhD admission rates dropping from 19% to 10% in that same period. In the opinion of multiple authors of this guide, graduate admissions involves a significant amount of chance. Although our feelings of imposter syndrome may try to convince us otherwise, many strong applicants are rejected and some less-prepared applicants are admitted.  

PhD applicants who have been involved in an independent study or undergraduate research project can sit down with their advisors, bring their unofficial transcripts and CVs, and ask for an assessment of where (i.e., what rank) they would be accepted at “on average.” Master’s applicants can do the same with any professor they took a rigorous elective with, or worked as a teaching assistant for, etc., but they may want to schedule the appointment early to make sure that it happens.

This is potentially a controversial opinion, but I have found that the actual school for a master’s or PhD program matters quite a bit less than most students think. As noted earlier in this guide, a master’s helps you enter the workforce at a higher position—the credential itself (and your performance in the interview) is what matters. PhD programs follow an apprenticeship model: you are learning the craft of research from an expert (your advisor). Within reason, your choice of advisor can have a much bigger impact on your overall success than the school name on your diploma. There are certainly reasons you might wish to have a degree from school XYZ, but your time is much better spent looking at the faculty you will learn from and collaborate with.

Don't be influenced by prestige alone when picking a PhD program. Remember, you are committing to 4-6 years in a specific lab, with a specific advisor, working on a highly specialized topic. Your success and happiness will depend on the quality of that environment. Prioritize finding a research area that genuinely excites you and an advisor whose mentorship style fits your needs. You can always ask to meet with the students of the lab to understand these better. These factors are ultimately more important than a school's ranking. If you can find both a great fit and a top-ranked school, you've hit the jackpot.

Graduate programs are often assessed using nebulous metrics known as **rankings.** There is much more to a graduate program, and much more to graduate applications, than simple rankings. However, rankings do correlate with selectivity and they can be a useful tool for generating initial ideas about where to apply. The two primary rankings for computer science are:

- **[US News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings):** Informally, this ranking of all departments is based on surveys sent to officials at all departments. That is, it tracks perception and reputation (like a “popularity contest”). While this might seem arbitrary, it can be quite useful for many students. If your goal is to get a master’s degree and then enter the workforce, the broad public perception of how prestigious the school is will likely matter more to your future job applications than will the number of research papers published at that school.

- **[CSRankings](https://csrankings.org):** Informally, this ranking is based entirely on bibliometrics: numbers and statistics about how many peer-reviewed scientific publications each department produces in various areas.

One powerful trick is to use CSRankings to identify a school that is ranked higher in the area you care about but lower overall. For example, suppose you are interested in Programming Languages and Software Engineering. In a particular semester, North Carolina State University may be ranked 34th by CSRankings and 51st by US News when all disciplines are included. However, if you turn off all of the areas and then turn on just Software Engineering and Programming Languages, NCSU is now ranked 13th by CSRankings! This suggests that NCSU is particularly strong in PL and SE, but may be weaker in other areas. If you are worried about getting into graduate school, that can be very helpful information. All other things being equal (this is a big simplification), the selectivity of a school is more related to its overall ranking, but the benefit you get out of it may be based on its ranking in your area. So if you know that you want to focus on PL or SE, NCSU may be easier to get into and may offer you a very high quality education once you arrive. (You can repeat this sort of search for whichever areas you personally care about.) 


You may find [Philip Guo’s vlog on choosing CS graduate schools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOSl3xPmHiQ&t=1s) useful as an additional perspective.

Beyond hard limiters like money or family/partner things, I think that my top three reasons to choose or apply to a program were well-ordered. 

1. #1. Advisor personality fit → are they someone you have similar values to/agree with on their mission and someone you can speak honestly to?
2. #2. Advisor research fit
3. #3. University fit → climate, location, ethos, prestige/connections

Your advisor has influence over many of your activities in grad school and consequently can have a large influence over your happiness. A great advisor–advisee fit will often allow you to explore, or give you an appreciation for, new areas, making research fit at the outset less important. Don’t make yourself unhappy in the long run by prioritizing something for the wrong reasons. If you don’t enjoy indirectness or your advisor being hands-on, for example, consider these quirks seriously and include them in your roundabout questioning.

Finally, we note two common pitfalls. The first is restricting attention to a particular location, such as “I will only apply to schools on the East Coast”. You can do a geographically-targeted graduate school application, but we encourage you to double-check this guide’s suggestions on mitigating risks and contingency planning. Second, some lower-ranked PhD programs are easier to get into but are not fully funded. That is a complicated topic of discussion, but the authors of this guide strongly recommend against such programs for PhD applicants. It is typically better to apply again next year than to accept such an offer; PhD programs that ask you to pay your own way rarely have your best interests at heart. 


# Mitigating and Dealing with Risk

Graduate school applications are inherently uncertain. If you are applying to programs with an average 10% admissions rate, and you apply to 15 programs, “all other things being equal” you have an 80% chance of getting into at least one. But that’s still a 20% chance of receiving no offers of admission. 

**Planning for potential rejection.** If you are worried about ending up with no offers of admission, we recommend discussing things with your advisor. In some cases, it may simply be a tougher year. Graduate school is counter-cyclic with respect to the economy (but at a slight time lag): it could be that overall applications are up this year, and since program space remains about the same, that makes programs more selective overall. It could be that federal funding was down the previous year, and thus programs made fewer offers of admission to PhD applicants. It could also be that you are thinking of applying to schools that are too selective with respect to the average perception of your application strength. In cases like these, multiple contingency plans are possible. For example, you might apply to a wider spread of schools this year, but also be prepared to work for a year and re-apply to graduate schools next year. 

It could also be that there is something special or risky about your application. For example, perhaps your undergraduate degree was in one topic (like Psychology) and now you are applying to graduate school in another topic (like Computing). Or perhaps you are restricting attention to schools in a very tight geographical area as one way to deal with a dual career situation. In these situations, the risk mitigation strategy is often specific. A student with a non-CS major might want to establish a record of CS research with a CS publication before applying. A student with a tight locational constraint might want to plan to apply over 2-3 years, rather than just 1.

 Rejections are very hard. I found it extremely difficult to cope with them. But even though it hurts, try to stay confident and remind yourself that something better awaits. A positive mindset helps: if it didn’t work out, maybe it wasn’t meant for me, and maybe what comes next will suit me even better. Ultimately, you will get what works best for you. This mindset really helped me. For example, I did not apply for internships early enough and ended up not getting one at first. It was very discouraging, but then I was offered a Research Associate position at the University of Michigan. Looking back, it was actually much better than what I had expected from an internship. I had already worked as a software engineer for 2 years in India, and during my master’s I wanted to delve more into research. The RA position gave me the chance to learn deeply, gain confidence, and explore the possibility of pursuing a PhD. Later in June, when most people had already started their internships, I also received an internship offer, but I chose to stay with the RA role because it aligned better with my goals. The reason I share this is because when I felt like everything was going wrong, I ended up with an opportunity that was even better for me. There are so many opportunities here, so don’t panic and don’t set rigid timelines for yourself. Things will work out at the right time, and your timeline doesn’t have to match anyone else’s.

In general, we suggest applying to a range of schools (including some aspirational schools and some safety choices, in a distribution), applying to at least a dozen schools, applying to industrial positions at the same time (but knowing how to interpret their borderline deceptive short-fuse terminology; see elsewhere in this guide), and making a backup plan for what happens if you do not receive an offer of admission. 


# Letters of Recommendation
You typically need three letters of recommendation to apply to a graduate program. In general, one of these should be a strong (“primary”) letter of recommendation. The other two can be weaker (“secondary”) letters of recommendation. 

The degree to which the letter writers need to “actually” know you varies between Master’s and PhD programs. 
For a Master’s program, a primary letter from a professor who taught you in a (or multiple) rigorous, upper-level elective that you did a very good job in can suffice. If you have an academic advisor who is one of your professors, this is also an excellent choice. (Recall that Master’s degree programs focus on success in graduate-level coursework.) 
For a PhD program, your primary letter writer should be someone you worked on a non-trivial project with. The strongest such letters describe undergraduate research projects. However, independent study projects can suffice, as can professors from classes where you did a particularly ambitious job on the final project. 

As a general rule, at most one letter-writer can be from industry (e.g., from an internship). Whether or not someone is from industry “shouldn’t” matter, but in practice it has two potential impacts. The first is that some committee members are biased against letters from industry. The second is that some industry letters include the wrong sort of information: what you would include in a reference for someone transferring from one branch of IBM to another isn’t exactly the same as what you’d say to help someone get into graduate school. You can mitigate both of these risks with some early planning. First, we recommend choosing someone from the company that has a graduate degree: people who have gone through the graduate school process successfully are more believable when they say you can do it! Second, we recommend reminding your letter writers of what we are looking for in terms of evidence and argument (see the information on essays and statements of purpose in this guide). If you have only worked in industry a few years, it’s entirely reasonable to reach out to your professors to request a letter. Especially for graduates from smaller programs, your professors haven’t forgotten you or your achievements. In larger schools, professors commonly receive requests from students who have graduated: if you are worried that the professor might not remember you, including a few details (e.g., “I did my final project on XYZ in your class and talked with you during office hours about ABC”) usually suffices. 

Any of the following can make a good letter writer. This list is not exclusive.

1. A professor who supervised an undergraduate research project leading to a submitted, peer-reviewed publication. This is the gold standard, and it is rare in general. It is common among applicants to top-ten PhD programs. 
1. A professor who supervised an undergraduate research project that you presented as a poster at a professional (or regional undergraduate) conference.
1. A professor who supervised an undergraduate research project that was never actually submitted for peer review. 
1. A professor who supervised an independent study project.
1. A professor who taught a class for which you were a teaching assistant.
1. A professor who taught a class for which you were a grader (especially if you stood out or did a good job). 
1. A professor who served as your academic advisor and whom you interacted with for more than just one or two advising meetings a year.
1. A professor who was the advisor for an official club (e.g., solar-powered car this, clean water project that, etc.) that you participated in (especially if you stood out or were an officer).
1. A professor who was the advisor for a service activity you were involved in (e.g., broadening participation in computing, helping to get people from all backgrounds involved, etc.), especially if you stood out or were an officer. 
1. A professor who taught an upper-level CS technical elective that you did a good job in (especially if you stood out on some element, such as a theoretical exam or implementation project, or if the course is known to be particularly rigorous at your school).
1. A professor who taught a graduate-level CS course that you took (yes, you can sign up for graduate courses as an undergraduate). 

Overall, the key factor isn’t the nature of the relationship (e.g., professor in class vs. advisor in club or whatever) but whether or not the person can describe specific situations in which you did things that correlate with success in graduate school. 

Many students find that they know who the primary letter writer would be, but they aren’t as certain about the others. You can talk to your primary letter writer about the right strategy for choosing the other letter writers. 

Once you have identified potential letter writers, you need to approach them to see if they are willing to do so. 

When applying online, you should **always waive your right to see your letters of recommendation**. When submitting a recommendation, the letter writer can see whether you did so or not. If you do not waive your right, many letter writers (including Wes Weimer, etc.) will not feel comfortable submitting a letter for you. That is because many people view letters as conditioned on confidentiality (i.e., the recommender is providing a reference conditioned on the fact that the contents of that reference will be kept confidential). Some applicants think that seeing your letters is necessary to keep track of who has submitted and by what date. In practice, those functions are unrelated and independent on recommendation systems. You should waive your right to see the content; the system can still tell you if the letter was submitted or not. 

{% capture quote %}
Waive your right to see your letters on every application. Technically it’s your right to see them, but it can only hurt your chances if you choose not to do so. Some believe it implies that the letter is not purely the opinion of the recommender because you had to make a pass over it.

# Approaching Letter Writers

Many students report that approaching people about writing letters of recommendation is nerve-wracking. We have three concrete pieces of advice for doing so.

1. Approach professors early. Many professors, especially popular professors from larger classes, receive many requests. Professors can typically only agree to a limited number of them while still doing a good job for those who asked first and received an early commitment. (Trying to write 50 letters at the last minute and doing a bad job on each one does not help anyone.) As a result, many professors (including authors of this guide) have an explicit limit and turn down every student once that limit is reached.  
    1. While the exact date will depend on your institution, if applications are due on December 15th, asking on December 14th is doomed to failure. For example, Wes recommends to his own students that they approach professors at least two months in advance (e.g., in October). 
1. Use phrasing that “leaves a diplomatic way out”. Some people feel uncomfortable refusing students, especially across cultural or language barriers. A person who does not want to write you a letter, does not know you well enough to do so, or does not have time to do so completely, is worse than not having a letter from that person at all. You do not want your letter writer to feel “trapped” or “obligated” into writing a letter: those letters have very stilted, shallow content that is assessed very poorly by admissions committees (who are on the lookout for them). 
    1. Wes personally recommends phrasing like “Do you have enough information and time to feel comfortable writing me a positive letter of recommendation?” Note the emphasis on bits like “Would you feel comfortable?” rather than “Can you?”. It’s then easier for the professor to turn you down easily without anyone “losing face”: “I don’t have quite enough information from when you took the class” could mean “I don’t have quite enough information” or it could mean “I do have enough information, but I actually don’t think you’re very good!” In either case, you don’t want that letter, and diplomatic phrasing makes it easier to receive the hint. (Ideally humans would just be direct about this, but not everyone is.) 
    1. Kevin recommends similar phrasing, such as “If you can’t commit to writing more letters at this time or don’t feel comfortable writing a positive letter of recommendation, I certainly understand.”  Beyond giving your letter writer a graceful “out” if it's needed, this also demonstrates your respect for the writer’s time.
1. Clearly indicate “Primary” or “Secondary” and “Master’s” or “PhD”. Success in master’s programs and PhD programs is seen as based on different things (e.g., rigorous coursework vs. research). If you don’t specify, the professor may well assume you’re applying to PhD programs (e.g., the professors all have PhDs and may see it as the default). If you are applying for a master’s program and did well in a professor’s class but did not work on research with the professor, the professor may turn you down, assuming that you want a research-describing letter that professor cannot provide. Similarly, many letter writers may turn down students for “primary” letters that they would accept writing “secondary” letters for. A secondary letter does not require as much information or as deep of a relationship. You do not want the professor to think you mean “primary” when you actually mean “secondary”. 
    1. Wes personally recommends including this information right next to the “would you feel comfortable” sentence. Example: “Do you have enough information and time to feel comfortable writing me a positive secondary letter of recommendation for a master’s degree program? Professor XYZ will be writing a primary letter for me.” 
1. Provide clear, organized, and detailed information for your letter writers. After agreeing to write a recommendation, your letter writers will be doing many things other than writing your letter.  Some professors request supporting materials (e.g., a resume/CV, draft statement of purpose, transcript, etc.) as part of your request while others ask for this information after the fact. Having these materials ready to share is both courteous and helps your letter writers craft strong narratives (i.e., emphasize key evidence of the low risk, high reward nature of your application). 
    1. Kevin personally recommends sharing a spreadsheet of schools with each letter writer. Only include schools for which you are requesting a letter from the writer (some students will mix and match letter writers), and indicate the degree, program, and application due date in this list. Recommendation requests often get swept up by spam filters, so having a list for cross-checking is very helpful. It also helps for tailoring letters to specific programs.

While all of the application materials that you write or prepare (e.g., your application essays, your transcript, etc.) are due by the application due date, letters of recommendation are sometimes turned in later. Admissions committees understand that you cannot force your letter writers to turn things in faster and do not penalize you for their actions. Website and admission form verbiage will often make it seem like your application will be summarily rejected if any component of the application is late; in reality, your application may be rejected if your materials are late but will not be rejected if your letter writers take another few weeks. See elsewhere in this guide for details and a concrete example. This is difficult for applicants to believe, but it is true.
