# Identifying Schools

If you are applying, getting into one or more graduate programs is **“infinitely” better than getting into zero.** To mitigate the risk, we recommend applying to many programs and applying to a **broad range of programs** (i.e., programs of varying selectivity).  

To see why, suppose, for simplicity, that every school independently has a 10% chance of accepting your application. (See historical Michigan numbers above for comparison; the advice here is primarily drawn from US schools.) If you apply to “only” five programs, there is a (100% - 10%)^5 = 59% chance that the biased coin comes up “tails” each time and you are rejected by all programs. So we want to apply to many programs.  

However, even applying to 15 programs with 10% acceptance rates still leaves a 20% chance of being rejected by all of them, so we also recommend applying to programs with a range of selectivities. This usually takes the form of ~10 schools in a band, 1–2 *“aspirational”* schools (long-shot selective schools that would be great, but may not accept you) and 3–4 *“safety”* schools (less-selective schools that are more likely to accept you).  

Students we work with typically apply to **12–16 programs.** If you apply to more than 16 programs, you run the risk of failing to secure letter writers or offending your letter writers. While letters of recommendation are primarily shared between institutions, letter writers often specialize them to particular schools, and so it is an increasing imposition to ask them to write too many letters.  

In general, graduate programs have become increasingly selective in recent years: few applicants are admitted. For example, the Michigan historical data (see FIXME in this guide) shows master’s degree admission dropping from 15% to 5% from 2014 to 2024 and PhD admission rates dropping from 19% to 10% in that same period. In the opinion of multiple authors of this guide, graduate admissions involves a significant amount of chance. Although our feelings of imposter syndrome may try to convince us otherwise, many strong applicants are rejected and some less-prepared applicants are admitted.  

PhD applicants who have been involved in an independent study or undergraduate research project can sit down with their advisors, bring their unofficial transcripts and CVs, and ask for an assessment of where (i.e., what rank) they would be accepted at “on average.” Master’s applicants can do the same with any professor they took a rigorous elective with, or worked as a teaching assistant for, etc., but they may want to schedule the appointment early to make sure that it happens.

This is potentially a controversial opinion, but I have found that the actual school for a master’s or PhD program matters quite a bit less than most students think. As noted earlier in this guide, a master’s helps you enter the workforce at a higher position—the credential itself (and your performance in the interview) is what matters. PhD programs follow an apprenticeship model: you are learning the craft of research from an expert (your advisor). Within reason, your choice of advisor can have a much bigger impact on your overall success than the school name on your diploma. There are certainly reasons you might wish to have a degree from school XYZ, but your time is much better spent looking at the faculty you will learn from and collaborate with.

Don't be influenced by prestige alone when picking a PhD program. Remember, you are committing to 4–6 years in a specific lab, with a specific advisor, working on a highly specialized topic. Your success and happiness will depend on the quality of that environment. Prioritize finding a research area that genuinely excites you and an advisor whose mentorship style fits your needs. You can always ask to meet with the students of the lab to understand these better. These factors are ultimately more important than a school's ranking. If you can find both a great fit and a top-ranked school, you've hit the jackpot.

Graduate programs are often assessed using nebulous metrics known as **rankings.** There is much more to a graduate program, and much more to graduate applications, than simple rankings. However, rankings do correlate with selectivity and they can be a useful tool for generating initial ideas about where to apply. The two primary rankings for computer science are:

- **[US News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings):** Informally, this ranking of all departments is based on surveys sent to officials at all departments. That is, it tracks perception and reputation (like a “popularity contest”). While this might seem arbitrary, it can be quite useful for many students. If your goal is to get a master’s degree and then enter the workforce, the broad public perception of how prestigious the school is will likely matter more to your future job applications than will the number of research papers published at that school.

- **[CSRankings](https://csrankings.org):** Informally, this ranking is based entirely on bibliometrics: numbers and statistics about how many peer-reviewed scientific publications each department produces in various areas.

One powerful trick is to use CSRankings to identify a school that is ranked higher in the area you care about but lower overall. For example, suppose you are interested in *Programming Languages* and *Software Engineering.* In a particular semester, North Carolina State University may be ranked 34th by CSRankings and 51st by US News when all disciplines are included. However, if you turn off all of the areas and then turn on just *Software Engineering* and *Programming Languages,* NCSU is now ranked 13th by CSRankings!  

This suggests that NCSU is particularly strong in PL and SE, but may be weaker in other areas. If you are worried about getting into graduate school, that can be very helpful information. All other things being equal (this is a big simplification), the selectivity of a school is more related to its overall ranking, but the benefit you get out of it may be based on its ranking in your area. So if you know that you want to focus on PL or SE, NCSU may be easier to get into and may offer you a very high-quality education once you arrive. (You can repeat this sort of search for whichever areas you personally care about.)  

You may find [Philip Guo’s vlog on choosing CS graduate schools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOSl3xPmHiQ&t=1s) useful as an additional perspective.

Beyond hard limiters like money or family/partner things, I think that my top three reasons to choose or apply to a program were well-ordered.  
1. Advisor personality fit → are they someone you have similar values to/agree with on their mission and someone you can speak honestly to?  
2. Advisor research fit  
3. University fit → climate, location, ethos, prestige/connections  

Your advisor has influence over many of your activities in grad school and consequently can have a large influence over your happiness. A great advisor–advisee fit will often allow you to explore—or give you an appreciation for—new areas, making research fit at the outset less important. Don’t make yourself unhappy in the long run by prioritizing something for the wrong reasons. If you don’t enjoy indirectness or your advisor being hands-on, for example, consider these quirks seriously and include them in your roundabout questioning.

Finally, we note two common pitfalls. The first is restricting attention to a particular location, such as *“I will only apply to schools on the East Coast.”* You can do a geographically targeted graduate school application, but we encourage you to double-check this guide’s suggestions on mitigating risks and contingency planning. Second, some lower-ranked PhD programs are easier to get into but are **not fully funded.** That is a complicated topic of discussion, but the authors of this guide strongly recommend against such programs for PhD applicants. It is typically better to apply again next year than to accept such an offer; PhD programs that ask you to pay your own way rarely have your best interests at heart.
