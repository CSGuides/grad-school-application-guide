# Preparing Your Statements

Your statements are the core of your application. Almost all jobs for
fresh Ph.D.'s require a [Research Statement](#research-statement). Most 
academic jobs also require a [Teaching Statement](#teaching-statement) and
a [Diversity Statement](#diversity-statement).

### General Advice for All Statements

1. **Start Early:** Writing these statements can take a 
  surprisingly long time. Many people feel that their statements 
  don’t fully reflect who they are as people. The job application 
  process often forces a “putting yourself forward” or “please hire me” 
  tone that may not feel authentic. **Start early and seek regular 
  feedback** because your own draft efforts will invariably 
  feel stupid to you.

2. **Review Examples:** Reviewing examples can help you 
  understand what’s expected for the jobs you are applying for. It can
  also help you "face the tyranny of the blank page" and start writing.
  This Guide contains a collection of [Example Materials](/grad-job-guide/exampleMaterials)
  that may help you get started. Additionally, consider asking friends and
  mentors who were recently on the job market to share their materials. 
  
   Another strategy is to download examples from others who have recently 
  applied for jobs. Many applicants post their materials on their 
  websites, and a quick Google search (e.g., programming languages 
  "teaching statement") can yield hundreds of results. We recommend
  searching for and downloading last year's materials the summer 
  before you apply (e.g.,
  May/June), before successful applicants remove them from
  their websites. Of course, if you get random people from the Internet you probably won't have heard of them and thus won't know if they are good or bad
  examples. So try to soak up all of the documents from people in your
  department that you can get a read on.


3. **Focus on Structure:** Ensure that your statements are 
  well-organized with clear topic sentences and logical flow. 
  Some faculty reviewers might skim your statements rather than reading 
  them in full. Use **bolding** and other structural elements to 
  make sure the main ideas are easy to grasp at a glance, 
  and to encourage readers to engage more thoroughly with your application.

4. **Make Your Statements Available Online:** Make sure that your materials are
  available on your website. Even if you've officially sent in your materials,
  faculty reviewing your application may download them directly from your
  webpage, as official application systems can be difficult to navigate.
  In addition, many of your interviewers will look 
  at your materials the day (or even hour) before they speak with you, 
  and they will likely look on your website first. 


<!--Make sure that yours are available
on-line as well. Many places, even places to which you have officially sent
materials, will get the versions off of your web page because the official
application materials get lost in the bureaucracy or were printed out
somewhere or somesuch. Wes was involved in multiple phone and sit-down
interviews where people mentioned reading the materials from his web page as
they were talking.  

While we're on the subject, people will, in fact, read the details of your web
page when they are considering you as a candidate. For example, Dave Evans at
Virginia mentioned (somewhat tongue-in-cheek, somewhat not) that one of the
reasons he knew Wes would fit in and be a solid hire is that he read and liked
the parody programming languages examination test on his web page. Both Wes and
Claire had multiple people comment on the photos or hobbies mentioned on their
web pages, even if those mentions were exceedingly brief (such as Claire's
involvement with her local roller derby league).


As of 2013, there exists a larger collection of such materials floating
around in the email archives of recently-hired junior faculty in Software
Engineering.  Contact Claire if you're seriously on the market, and she will see
if she can access it for you, so long as you solemnly vow to share your own
materials after your search concludes.-->

We now detail each statement in turn.

## Research Statement
The traditional approach here is to craft your research statement 
by summarizing your thesis proposal. These statements are typically 3-4
pages long and start with an overview of your research goals. They then 
discuss each main thrust of your thesis proposal. If you are applying for a 
teaching-focused job, such as in Liberal Arts academia, you might consider 
including a section on the role undergraduate mentorship plays in your 
research.

References aren't required in a research 
statement, but they don't hurt if you feel better including them (
or if you have a bunch of publications and
want to highlight that). [Kevin Leach](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) notes that by the time he was
applying for jobs, he had published across several disciplines.  He used
citations in his research statement to help the reader follow which
publications were most relevant in constructing a coherent narrative.

For examples of research statements, see the 
[Example Materials](/grad-job-guide/exampleMaterials) tab.

## Teaching Statement

Teaching statements are typically 2-3 pages long, with longer
being more common if you are going for a teaching-focused role.

They usually begin with an overview of your *teaching philosophy*,
which communicates your beliefs about teaching and learning. This
includes how you approach your role as an educator and how you
engage with students. It may
take some time to develop your teaching philosophy. If you are stuck,
it can be helpful to brainstorm specific examples from your teaching
experiences that you might want to talk about, and then think about if there
are any underlying values connecting them. In the rest of your statement, you'll want to
summarize your teaching experience, and then demonstrate how your
teaching philosophy is realized through compelling examples and
anecdotes.  Specificity is helpful.  

It is not unusual for tenure track applicants to have relatively little explicit
teaching experience. If you are applying for such a *research-focused* position,
it's also often beneficial to include your approach to mentoring junior
researchers (with, again, specific examples). You can also signal awareness of
modern pedagogy by educating yourself and using associated vocabular
appropriately, without overdoing it; such awareness is nice to see in a tenure
track applicant, as it can suggest thoughtfulness, even if you don't have as
much experience.

If you are going for a *teaching-focused* position, you may want to focus more
on classroom teaching, and talk about your experience with lecturing and course
design.

For examples of teaching statements, see the 
[Example Materials](/grad-job-guide/exampleMaterials) tab.

Overall, most teaching statements tend to look
somewhat similar. At Wesleyan, the only place [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) went
that mentioned his teaching statement at all, they mentioned that it was
creative and the best one they had seen in a while.  Given how interesting
his isn't, that gives you a good idea for how low the bar is set if you
want to do something personal with your teaching statement. Being
yourself is still key, however. Not everyone should go for a teaching
statement in which they claim not to be nice.
[Kevin Angstdat](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s statement
is something of an upper bound on teaching statement
impressiveness, and a statement
like his works well if you're aiming for a teaching job.

## Diversity Statement

Since 2015, Diversity Statements (or Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion Statements) have
become increasingly popular (sometimes given names like "Broader Impact" statements). These are typically 1-2 pages long 
and demonstrate your commitment to contributing to a supportive 
and inclusive environment. We provide additional guidance on these statements because
they may be less familiar to applicants and because there may be less "institutional knowledge" 
about them. 

In our personal opinion, the best diversity statements focus
on actions you've taken for sustainable change and support rather than 
meaningless platitudes. For example,
[Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) talked about organizing a speaker series to expose students
to different CS careers, including metrics on attendance and
and the positive feedback she received. However, some readers may 
expect a diversity philosophy at the start.

From the faculty side, [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), who has chaired or been
involved in Diversity Committees for
many years at multiple institutions, and helped push for the 
consideration of Diversity Statements at Michigan, encourages you to place an 
emphasis on showing your <i>understanding</i> of the complexity and nuance of these issues, as well as the 
<i>activities</i> you have carried out (or plan to carry out) to improve climate and broaden participation in computing, rather
than on your personal <i>identity</i>. Many institutions, especially some state schools, are forbidden from
considering applicant identity directly. In that light, "I am a member of group XYZ" may be less compelling
than "I founded a summer program to support XYZ students, and used my personal experience as a member of that group
to focus activities on challenges ABC and DEF, which may disproportionately impact members of that population." 

When writing about activities, [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) further encourages you to include numbers and outcomes where possible. For example, 
list how many people attended your community-building event, quantify how participants found your speaker series helpful, 
count how many of the high school students you spoke to went on to apply to college, and so on. This may require planning in
advance: if you have already done the hard work of bringing in and advertising a guest speaker, 
giving all of the attendees a survey with a few multiple choice (e.g., Likert scale) or freeform questions is not much 
more effort, but will strengthen your Diversity Statement. For example, a hiring committee
choosing between applicants stating 

> I organized a community-building ice cream social for first-year XYZ students

and 

> I organized a community-building ice cream social for first-year XYZ students. 20 people attended and participants gave an average survey response of 4.6/5.0 to the statement "This event made me more likely to declare the CS major." One participant wrote, "I thought there wouldn't be anyone else like me in CS, but I met some fun people here."

... will almost certainly find the second to be more compelling. In addition, we encourage you to
include any evidence that your efforts have spanned multiple years and that they will continue without you.
Informally, administrations often see diversity activities as falling into a "graveyard of broken dreams", where one enthusiastic person
runs an activity for one cycle and then graduates or moves on, and the activity falls apart without that leader. 
Evidence that you have trained replacements, secured funding, or otherwise started something that will
continue to operate "on its own" will look particularly attractive. 
Because hiring committees are looking to hire you for many years, and institutions often make decisions about
which programs to continue based on these considerations (e.g., how many people did it help, to what degree did it help them,
how much did it cost in terms of time or resources, can it be sustained, etc.), including that sort of information
in your essay will make it easier for the committee to conclude that you align with their institutional practices. 

Concretely, many US universities have recently produced, adapted and refined rubrics for evaluating
Diversity Statements. Many of these show a convergence of ideas and best practices. For example, the Michigan State Univeristy
rubric is based on the University of California at Berkeley rubric, which was itself adapted by the University of California at Irvine, etc. 
Using these rubrics to guide the construction of your Diversity Statement is thus more likely to result in a single
statement that is assessed positively at multiple institutions. Some of these rubrics can
be harder to find on the web (e.g., they may be structured for faculty hiring committees, not for applicants), so we have archived three public 
examples here for your convenience:
