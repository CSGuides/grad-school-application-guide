# Writing Application Essays

Most programs require one or more essays as part of the application. These essays are a chance to demonstrate your writing ability and how you think about research and learning.  

For master’s programs, these essays are typically brief and focus on your coursework preparation and how the program aligns with your goals. For PhD programs, they should also demonstrate your understanding of research, curiosity, and perseverance.

## Applications: Length Constraints and Guidelines

Graduate school essays typically have limits on both character and word count. For example, one program might allow 1,000 words while another only allows 3,000 characters (roughly 500 words). These limits are strict and often enforced by the application portal.

When you draft your essays, write them as if there were no word limit to get your ideas out clearly. Then, cut them down while preserving your key points. This helps you avoid sounding constrained or vague.  

You should have **different versions** of your essays for different programs, adapted to the specific prompt and word limit.

## Writing Approach

Treat your statement of purpose as a **narrative** that ties together your background, interests, and goals. Your goal is to tell a clear and authentic story about who you are, what motivates you, and why the program is the right fit.  

Avoid generic statements that could apply to anyone. Instead, be specific and concrete: describe particular projects, courses, or experiences that shaped your interests.

A helpful approach is to outline your essay around these four areas:

1. **Background and motivation.**  
   What sparked your interest in computing or your chosen field? Mention personal, educational, or professional experiences that led you here.
2. **Preparation.**  
   Highlight experiences that demonstrate readiness: coursework, research, teaching, internships, or relevant projects. Use specific examples.
3. **Research or career interests.**  
   For PhD programs, describe the areas you wish to explore and why. For master’s programs, discuss what skills or knowledge you hope to gain.
4. **Fit and future goals.**  
   Explain why this program in particular suits your goals. If possible, mention faculty members whose work aligns with your interests or aspects of the program that appeal to you.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Avoid repeating information from your resume verbatim. The essays should provide **context** and **reflection** — explain *why* your experiences mattered and how they changed you.

Do not focus too heavily on a single story (e.g., one course or project) to the exclusion of everything else. Instead, use that story to illustrate larger themes.

Avoid overemphasizing childhood anecdotes (e.g., “I started coding at age eight”). It’s okay to mention your early interests briefly, but the majority of your essay should focus on experiences during college or later.

Avoid phrases that sound overly grandiose or self-congratulatory (e.g., “I was destined to revolutionize computer science”). Focus on concrete skills, curiosity, and persistence.

## Statement of Purpose vs. Personal Statement

Many applications ask for two essays: a **Statement of Purpose (SOP)** and a **Personal Statement (PS)**.  

- The **SOP** focuses on your academic preparation, research interests, and professional goals.  
- The **PS** focuses on your personal background, obstacles you’ve overcome, and factors that shaped your educational path.

If the program only asks for one essay, combine both elements thoughtfully — show both your intellectual preparation and your personal motivation.

## Faculty Matching

For PhD applications, it is crucial to mention **specific faculty members** whose work aligns with your interests. This shows that you have done your homework and understand the department’s research areas.

Be genuine — don’t list every faculty member. Instead, focus on 2–3 whose work truly excites you and briefly explain why.  

If you have read one of their papers, reference it naturally (e.g., “I was inspired by Prof. X’s work on automated program repair, which influenced my senior thesis”). Avoid exaggeration or flattery.

## Revision and Feedback

Your first draft will not be your best. Plan time for multiple rounds of revision and feedback.  

Ask trusted readers — professors, mentors, peers, or writing centers — to review your essay. If you are reapplying in a later cycle, revisit your previous essays and reflect on what’s changed since then.  

When revising:
- Check that each paragraph has a clear purpose.
- Replace vague claims (“I am passionate about AI”) with evidence (“In my senior project, I developed a reinforcement learning agent to…”).
- Make sure your essay answers the prompt directly.

Finally, proofread carefully. Typos or careless grammar mistakes leave a poor impression, especially for programs emphasizing writing and communication skills.
