# Letters of Recommendation

Letters of recommendation are a critical part of your application, 
providing an external validation of your qualifications and potential. 
<span class="highlight">You will typically need three to five letters from individuals who know 
your work well.</span> Common letter writers include:

* **Your Primary Advisor**: This will be your longest and most important
  letter. 
* **Co-Advisor or Committee Members**: The longer your professional relationship, the 
  better. Prioritize committee members with whom you have co-authored a paper.
* **Internship Supervisor**: Especially useful for Industrial Research positions, and also a 
  good choice for academic positions if you co-authored a paper together.
* **Other Professors You've Worked With**: Prioritize those with whom you've
  published a paper, especially if they can provide unique insights not 
  covered by other letter writers.
* **A Faculty Co-Instructor**: If you are applying to *teaching-focused positions*, you 
  may have acted as an *instructor of record*. It can be valuable to have a letter writer 
  who can speak directly to your teaching and classroom management abilities.

While one of your letters will come from your advisor, you may 
have only published papers with your advisor and the
supervisor from you summer internship. *So where do you find the other two?*

Start now! Email other professors in your department and make appointments 
to discuss your research and plans. Ask if they have any ideas, talk about possible
collaborations, and seek their feedback on drafts of your papers. The better they 
know you, the stronger their letters can be, and you might even have some valuable 
research ideas in the process.

If you plan to do your job search interviews in the Spring of Year *X*, talk
to your advisor about who should write your letters in the Summer of Year 
*X-1* (or earlier!), and then ask them by the end of that summer. When 
discussing potential letter writers with your advisor, seek their input 
on who might provide the most compelling endorsements based on your career 
goals. Give your letter writers plenty of advance notice.

<a href="https://www.monperrus.net/martin/">Martin Monperrus</a> notes that letters of recommendation
are "very big in the US, not so big in Europe. Because of this cultural difference, European applicants may not realize how much effort they must put in for their US application letters."

At the end of the day, I can only offer myself as a data point for
what was "good enough". I had never written a paper with Alex Aiken but I
had corresponded with him since the end of my undergraduate days. We had
similar research interests, I almost ended up as his advisee, we got along
well at research group lunches, I went to his office more than once to talk
about research and ideas, and he invited me to Stanford to give a practice
talk. I had written a paper with Tom Henzinger, sat in on one of his
classes, and visited his office once or twice to talk about things and ask
for advice. I had never written a paper with Jim Larus but he supervised my
internship at Microsoft Research and was familiar with my research work. 
Left to my own devices, I would have chosen Sriram Rajamani (also from my
internship) instead of Jim since he knew me better personally, but it was
suggested that Jim's more senior position and experience in both industry
and academia would lead to a more useful reference. Talk to your advisors.

[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s advice about letter writers basically guided my
selection thereof: [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) was my adviser; Stephanie Forrest and I have worked and
written papers together for many years; I have taken classes, written at least
one paper, and supported grants with John Knight throughout my graduate career;
and Mark Harman and I have been in contact about my work since before I received
my Masters.  I was told by at least one department chair that the strength of my
letters was critically important to securing the interview(s) in question.  My subsequent experience participating in and chairing faculty searches at Carnegie Mellon, corroborates the importance of letters;  I
encourage you to select your recommenders carefully.

The jobs I applied for required a maximum of three letters and I was fortunate
enough to get letters from a subset of [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s letter writers: 
[Wes Weimer](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
(primary advisor), Stephanie Forrest (mentor and co-author on three papers), and
John Knight (with whom I took a class and often solicited advice from throughout
my grad career).  To highlight a potential pitfall, I will note that one of my
undergraduate advisors (with whom I was co-author on several papers) agreed to
write me a letter of recommendation, but noted that it might be somewhat weak
because of the time that had lapsed since our professional interaction.
[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s sage advice was that anyone who flat-out admits that they may not be
able to write you the strongest recommendation letter should be used as a last
resort.  While I very much appreciate the generosity and honesty of my previous
advisor, I am glad that I eventually chose someone with a more comprehensive
knowledge of my most recent work.

I applied to jobs that required between 3 and 4 letters of
recommendation.  Since I had spent 4 years as a postdoc, I had focused
on letter writers who were relevant during the later part of my PhD and
my postdoctoral appointment.   I had also applied both to teaching-track
and tenure-track positions -- this is important to relay to letter
writers as they may tailor letters to institutions accordingly.  Lastly,
as noted below, I really found a meticulously-organized chart of
deadlines, institutions, and URLs to be essential, especially as part of
a dual-career search.   Your letter writers may want their own chart to
track their own progress, but you will likely need to maintain it
yourself for each writer.

### Organizing Things for your Letter Writers

**Make a Spreadsheet for your Letter Writers:** To ensure that your letters of recommendation are submitted on time and to the correct places, 
it's essential to keep your letter writers organized and informed. 
We recommend that you create and share a spreadsheet with your letter writers that contains:

* The schools you are applying to
* The application deadline
* A link to the submission portal 
* Any special instructions or notes

You can see [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s letter-writer chart [here]({{ "/assets/materials/weimer/list.html" | relative_url }}).
It's not perfect and I'm sure you could improve on the format but no
one complained. It should also give you an idea of how the due dates vary
between top-tier teaching-ish schools (e.g., Oberlin at November 19) and
standard research schools (e.g. CMU at January 15).

**Letter Submission Process**: Most schools use some kind of special online web-system for
applications. If you're like [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) or [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), you will be annoyed by the fact
that the systems are all basically the same, yet each one requires you to 
create a new account. A few use [academicjobsonline.com](http://academicjobsonline.com)
or [Interfolio](https://www.interfolio.com/). These are by far
the easiest positions to apply for.

Regardless of the system used, schools typically accept letters of recommendation 
via email or through their online system. However, they may ask your letter writers 
to use a specific form or platform. For positions hosted on [academicjobsonline.com](http://academicjobsonline.com)
or [Interfolio](https://www.interfolio.com/), your letter writers can often submit one letter to multiple schools. If you go this route, make sure to:

1. **Communicate Clearly with Your Letter Writers:** Ensure they know not to mention a specific school name in the letter unless it's tailored for that school.
2. **Strategically Use This Option:** You may want to only use this approach with your secondary letter writers. Your advisor may want to customize their letter each schools. 

A couple of schools ask for letters only after a first cut of applications,
in which case they will contact your letter-writers directly.

Loosely, your letter-writers will write the letters a day or two before the
first one is due and then send them all out.

**Lost Letters:** As an aside, it is *very common* for letters of recommendation to fail to
make it all the way to the people who need to see them. This can be due to various issues,
such as:

* The letter writer did not submit a letter despite a request from the school.
* A miss-typed email address in your application.
* The school never issued a request for the letter.
* The letter was submitted but got lost in the process.
* The letter was successfully submitted, but the system failed to register it.  

[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) had at least six places email to say only one or two of his
letters gad arrived, asking to have the others emailed directly to some
address.  <!--Some UC-system schools are infamous for letter mishaps (e.g., losing more or less every letter from one year's worth of applicants).--> 
It is quite reasonable to send follow-up email to confirm that all of
your letters have been received (this also shows interest in
the position, but it's unlikely anyone will notice at this stage).
