# Submitting Your Application

Nothing surprising here. Email it in or otherwise make use of the online form
system in question. Often they will ask for everything to be in PDF
format. Sometimes they'll even want everything in a single PDF file, so be
prepared to be able to combine PDFs if needed.

I found it helpful to just make a copy of my materials
for each institution, then edit the copy accordingly.  Version control
was also super helpful -- since the application process spanned months,
some of my materials changed slightly over time.  By the time my
interviews were scheduled, I found it really helpful to be able to "go
back in time" to recall which materials I had submitted where.

Now that you have written and submitted your application materials, the next step is [interviewing](/grad-job-guide/interviewing)!.
