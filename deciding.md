# Making Decisions

In the U.S., graduate schools coordinate deadlines around **April 15th**.  
You can (and should) wait to make decisions until you have all offers in hand.

When comparing offers, consider both objective and personal factors:  
advisor fit, research interest alignment, stipend, location, ranking, morale, and department climate.

{% include quote.html content="All other things being equal, I encourage students to prioritize themselves rather than rankings, especially for PhD programs. It’s an endurance race—comfort, community, and location all matter." user="kevin" %}

Finally, be aware of **exploding industry offers**—companies may pressure you to decide before April 15th.  
While they might say you’ll have to “reapply,” strong candidates are almost always re-hired quickly in the next cycle.
