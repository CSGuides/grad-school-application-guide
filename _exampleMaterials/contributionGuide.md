# Comparisons, Nuance, and A Technique

While these example materials can be helpful, we encourage you to consider them
with care, lest they mislead you. [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) notes
that most academics suffer from [imposter
syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). Other job
applicants' materials can easily lead to a mental trap wherein you read them and
think "I have fewer publications than Person A and less teaching experience than
Person B, I'll never get a job!" You may not have noticed that Person A had no
teaching experience, or that Person B, no service contributions. Beware of
comparing your entire self to only the best attributes of others, and remember
that application materials serve to highlight the best, most hirable properties
of a candidate. They effectively never include mistakes, failures or
weaknesses. (Consider Melanie Stefan's notion of a [CV of
Failures](https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7322-467a) as a useful contrast!)

This page provides neither a random nor indicative sample of applicants, and the
materials are biased towards top-tier outcomes across multiple categories of
positions. These may be the right kinds of jobs for you to consider, but they
also might not be, for your career and personal goals! As a concrete example, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Forrest">Stephanie Forrest</a>
received R1 tenure-track offers from both the University of Michigan and also
the University of Arizona and accepted the offer at Arizona because it was a
better fit for her context.

In evaluating your own choices and possible outcomes, we encourage you to
consider:
-  _Opportunity costs_ relative to the job you're actually seeking. 
There is simply not enough time to do everything during your
graduate career. If you are looking for a
teaching-focused position, at a certain point, serving as instructor of record
in a course may be more useful than any number of additional peer-reviewed
publications. Conversely, if you are looking for an industrial research
position, spending a summer or two interning is likely much more useful than
teaching a class. Etc.
- Grounded information about the relationship between department selectivity and general
applicant profile. Leaving aside the
(important) conversation about whether rankings mean anything/are moral/useful,
etc, higher-ranked/"bigger-named" institutions often, on average, expect "more" of
successful faculty applicants. 
One way you can get a feeling for this in academia is to go to the
websites of schools you are considering, find recently-hired
faculty, download their CVs/check DBLP, and then _only consider the resume
items and publications they had by the year they were hired_. For example, you
might compare recently-hired faculty at the University of Michigan to
those at the Univeristy of New Mexico to develop a broad sense
of expectations.

The latter suggestion serves to help you mitigate your imposter syndrome while
giving you the information necessary to make good job search and career choices.
[Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) recommends that applicants seeking
academic jobs sit down (perhaps with their advisors) and determine that "on
average, my record is comparable to people who are hired at schools ranked
XYZ".  Then start, as a baseline, by applying to other schools in a
distribution around XYZ, but also include some "safety schools" that may be less
selective, and some "aspirational schools" that may be more selective, plus
schools that are particularly interested in (e.g., are building a center in,
have a history of strength in, etc.) an area that aligns with their expertise.

This guide originally started as a more internal project with a smaller scope
(e.g., writing down advice we would share with friends 
seeking certain types of jobs). It has grown to reach a wider
audience, but some aspects of it (e.g., some of the older materials, some of the
framing and writing) still have that old bias. I recommend that you 
not view these materials as
a lower bound when considering your own situation; instead, you should view them
as upper bounds.

# How to Contribute Materials

We are always looking for more application material profiles, especially for job-types or job-locations that are currently under-represented in our guide.

If you are interesting in contributing your materials, please fill out our contribution form available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLHwzuCsOcKHNBZBO9LGiWhVZPbcIE5-VpQ5hL8wQcFRAAMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). This form includes places to upload PDFs of your materials, as well as add any information you'd like to better contextualize your application for readers. In this form, you can also indicate if you'd like to be kept anonymous. All materials are optional -- we greatly appreciate anything you'd be willing to share!

If you have any questions about contributing, please email Madeline Endres at <mendres@umass.edu>.
