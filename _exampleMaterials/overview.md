# Overview of Materials

Writing application materials for graduate school can be challenging. To help you get started, this page offers a variety of examples and resources tailored for master’s degree programs and PhD programs.

We provide examples of the main application components, as well as complete application portfolios.  The portfolios are organized by date, with the newest listed first.  Additionally, all materials can be filtered by key attributes, including some (e.g., *“lower-GPA”*, *“non-US-undergrad-institution”*, *“no-published-research”*) that are often concerns for students. Please consider our advice on nuance when comparing yourself to these materials.

You may also want to check out [Zhaofeng Wu, Alexis Ross, and Shannon Shen’s **CS PhD Statements of Purpose repository**](https://cs-sop.notion.site/CS-PhD-Statements-of-Purpose-df39955313834889b7ac5411c37b958d).  It has a larger set of statements of purpose, but we note that it focuses solely on statements: it may not include transcripts, CVs, etc. In addition, since it may be more self-selected (compared to this more curated set), it may feature more materials from students who felt very confident in their accomplishments and fewer submissions from students who perceived weaknesses (e.g., lower GPAs, less research, etc.).

We thank everyone who contributed their materials to this project. If you are interested in contributing your materials, please see our [contribution guide](#how-to-contribute-materials).
