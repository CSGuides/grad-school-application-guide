# Overview of Materials

Writing application materials for post-doctoral positions can be challenging. 
To help you get started, this page offers a variety of examples and 
resources tailored for different types of jobs, including:

* R1 Tenure-Track Positions
* Liberal Arts Tenure-Track Positions
* Industrial Research Positions

We provide examples of the main application components, as well as 
complete application portfolios. The portfolios are organized by date, 
with the newest listed first. Additionally, all materials can be 
filtered by key attributes, such as primary research area(s), 
dual career situations, and job type. Please consider our 
[advice
on nuance when comparing to these materials](#comparisons-nuance-and-a-technique). 


We thank everyone who contributed their materials to this project. If you
