# Should I Apply to Graduate School?

In our opinion, the **primary reason to go to graduate school** is because you want one of the career paths that graduate school opens up.  
If you think ahead to the future and see yourself as a **professor**, a PhD is a necessary step along the way.  
If you see yourself in a position of **additional responsibility at a company**—a senior developer or manager, with more duties and a higher salary—a master’s degree is a great way to get there in the short term.  

<p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Wes</a> suggests: This may be a good opportunity to talk to some of your professors or industrial colleagues and ask them what they like about their jobs. Many student-professor interactions involve commiserating about difficulties. By contrast, many professors rarely talk about why they love the job, even though they do! If you are a teaching assistant, for example, you are more likely to hear professors complain about grading, but less likely to hear professors talk about how much they enjoy teaching students and giving lectures. Similarly, research professors often complain about deadlines or funding; you may benefit from asking them why they love their work and what it means to them.</p>

<p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Kevin</a> adds: I’ll reiterate Wes’s encouragement to talk to your professors early and often. As a student, you see one perspective of academic life at one institution. The reality is academic (and industrial) careers can be quite varied. Your professors have certainly considered (or worked in) many of these career options and are great resources for helping you learn more. Asking them about what kinds of jobs they considered and why they ultimately chose their current position can result in a very interesting conversation. Professors also often have contacts and friends from graduate school in other career paths, so they can often speak directly to non-academic careers as well.</p>

<p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#additional-contributors-and-student-perspectives">Sathvika</a> comments: Don’t wait to “feel ready.” Apply to jobs and graduate programs even if you think you aren’t prepared yet. Be delusional here too. You don’t have to know everything in advance. From my conversations with professors, for PhD all they really care about is whether you have research experience and a positive mindset. Research is a journey with highs and lows. Sometimes you work for months and realize it doesn’t lead to a valid result, and that is normal. What professors want to see is that you can stay open-minded, that you can say “I can try this, I can learn this new thing,” and that you can persist. Don’t let your own doubts stop you from applying.</p>

# Post-Graduate Careers

A **master’s degree** typically allows you to start further along the management or senior developer track at a company, in a position of more responsibility.  
The conventional wisdom is that you advance faster by spending two years getting a master’s degree than you would by spending two years at the company.

A **PhD** is typically required to be a professor, work at a top-tier industrial research lab, or lead a group at a research and development organization.  
The key reason to pursue a PhD is to qualify for one of the jobs that *requires* it.

## Career Options

A graduate degree is required for, or significantly helps with, many career options:

- **Tenure-track faculty at research universities (R1)** — These jobs feature the job security of tenure, a focus on cutting-edge research, flexible hours, opportunities for teaching and advising students, and international collaboration.  
- **Tenure-track faculty at liberal arts colleges** — These positions emphasize teaching and mentoring undergraduates, often with smaller classes and more interdisciplinary work.  
- **Teaching-track faculty at universities** — Focused on pedagogy and curriculum innovation, often with equivalent tenure protections or long-term contracts.  
- **Industrial researcher at large companies** — Positions at Microsoft Research, Intel Labs, Meta, or similar, focusing on innovation and technology transfer.  
- **Industrial researcher at academic or federal labs** — Examples include NASA, Raytheon BBN, MITRE, and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.  
- **Specialized industrial research labs** — Smaller labs that focus on niche domains like NLP, robotics, or software security (e.g., GrammaTech, Charles River Analytics).

While this guide defaults to a **U.S. perspective**, these positions have clear international analogs.  
For instance, tenure-track roles at McGill (Canada) or University College London (UK) are similar to U.S. models, and research institutes such as **Inria** (France) or **Max Planck Institutes** (Germany) parallel U.S. federal labs.

# Other Common Decision Factors

The decision to pursue a graduate degree involves weighing a number of **costs and benefits**.  
Below we summarize some of the most common considerations.

## Time Required

All graduate programs take time.  
The average **PhD** takes **5–7 years**, typically involving 2 years of coursework and 3–4 years of focused research.  
A stand-alone **master’s** degree takes much less time, especially in combined 4+1 or 5-year programs.

<p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Wes</a> notes: The shortest combined time for a master’s degree and PhD among my students is four years. A few students take 7–10. This varies by discipline. Theory work can sometimes go more quickly, while Systems work often requires time-consuming experimentation.</p>

## Long-Term Money

From a purely monetary perspective, the **master’s degree** typically offers the best return on investment.  
It’s shorter, raises your salary compared to a bachelor’s, and opens more opportunities.  
While PhD salaries are higher, the opportunity cost of the extra years means lifetime earnings are often lower for PhD holders.

For example, **UMass Amherst** students with master’s degrees earn over **$12,000 more** than those with only a bachelor’s in computer science.  
The **University of Michigan** also publishes detailed salary data by major and degree level.

## Short-Term Money

In computer science, **PhD students are almost always fully funded**—tuition, health insurance, and a stipend (often $20,000–$40,000 per year as of 2023).  
By contrast, master’s students generally pay tuition and receive limited or no funding.  
This makes the PhD appealing in the short term, even if the master’s offers higher lifetime earnings.

<p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Wes</a> observes: Some students consider applying to a PhD program, earning a master’s “along the way,” and leaving if it isn’t a good fit. While this can work, it’s harder than it sounds because PhD and master’s admissions prioritize different criteria.</p>

## Time Gaps Between Schooling

It’s very common to complete an undergraduate degree, work in industry, and then apply to graduate school.  
Being a “returning adult student” does *not* hurt your chances.

<p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Kevin</a> remarks: I’ve had a number of students work 1–3 years at a company before applying to graduate school. It’s also not uncommon for students to apply for both jobs and graduate programs at the same time.</p>

## Company, Government, or Military Support

Some organizations offer **tuition reimbursement** or **graduate school assistance programs**.  
These can be excellent opportunities, though they may restrict eligible schools or set aggressive completion timelines.

<p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Wes</a> adds: In my experience, U.S. military programs often assume very optimistic timelines—sometimes 1–2 years shorter than average. Despite that, they are definitely worth considering if applicable to you.</p>

## International Considerations

<p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#additional-contributors-and-student-perspectives">Sathvika</a> advises: Ignore unnecessary outside noise. You’ll hear a lot about jobs, funding, visas, and the future. It’s important to stay informed, but don’t get consumed. Visa news in particular can feel scary—one week there’s a rumor, the next it’s withdrawn or forgotten. Focus on what you can control: your own journey, effort, and growth.</p>

<span class="highlight">Ultimately, applying to graduate school is a deeply personal decision.</span>  
Consider your goals, motivations, and circumstances—not just prestige or expectations.  
This guide is here to help you make that decision thoughtfully.
