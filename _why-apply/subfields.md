# Academic Positions: Research Area and Where to Apply

<span class="highlight">Academic job postings may or may not be research-area specific.</span>
Most academic job ads use similar boilerplate language:

> "We encourage all qualified applicants from all
> areas of computer science to apply, we are an equal-opportunity employer...".

 
**However, the specific focus of a department's search can greatly influence your 
chances.** Below, we break down the two primary types of job ads and 
how to interpret them.

1. **Specific Focus Areas**: Some job postings explicitly state the areas of interest, 
  such as compilers or data mining. If your research aligns with these areas, 
  you have a stronger chance of being considered. If not, it may be difficult to secure 
  an interview. Here are a couple of examples:
  
    - From Purdue's 2005 search:
    > "The Department of Computer Sciences at Purdue University invites
      applications for tenure-track positions beginning August 2005. Positions
      are available at the Assistant Professor level; senior positions will be
      considered for highly qualified applicants. Applications from outstanding
      candidates in all areas of computer science will be considered. **Of
      particular interest are candidates in the areas of programming languages
      and compilers, software engineering, operating systems, data mining, and
      bioinformatics.**"

    - From Yale's 2024 search: 
    > "The Yale Computer Science Department 
      continues to invite applications for multiple tenure-track faculty positions to start in 
      the 2024-2025 academic year. **For this yearâ€™s search, we are interested in candidates working 
      in the areas of (1) AI and Trustworthy Computing or (2) Programming Languages.** With recent 
      explosive growth of large-language-model based technologies such as ChatGPT, we are 
      particularly interested in candidates who can take on the leadership role and help shape the 
      research and education impact of AI for the rest of the University. 
      Qualified applicants in computer science are invited to apply. 

2. **General Calls**: Other ads may list a broad range of departmental strengths, leaving you with 
  little specific information about what areas they are truly hiring for. 
  <!-- The other kind of ad says "our department has strengths in areas X, Y
  and Z and we are looking for people who can either augment or complement
  those strengths", at which point you really have no information since
  they've covered all of the bases. Here's a concrete example from Virginia's
  2005 search (emphasis mine): -->
  
    - From UVA's 2005 search:
    > The University of Virginia... offers baccalaureate, master, 
      and doctoral degrees in Computer Science
      and Computer Engineering. The department is undergoing significant growth
      and programmatic evolution and aims to be one of the top departments in
      experimental systems research and the leading institution in
      undergraduate computer science education. **Its existing strengths include
      algorithms, architecture, compilers, distributed systems, graphics, grid
      computing, mobile computing, networks, operating systems, programming
      environments, real-time and embedded systems, security, sensor networks,
      and software engineering.** 

    Despite the general phrasing, *most schools with this type of posting have an 
    internal area-related priority for hiring*. However, 
    unless you have a contact at the school, it can be difficult to know if they are hiring in 
    your specific subfield. 
    

**Overall, we recommend prioritizing schools with job postings that match your
research area.** Regarding general calls, we recommend applying only if the 
school aligns well with your career goals and personal preferences. 

**One notable exception to this rule is "top 10" schools.**  Such programs 
(especially the very large ones) often have multiple hiring lines, and may 
hire candidates they find exceptional, regardless of research area. 
*Thus, even if their calls are open, it's probably worth applying, because 
you never know.*  For example, CMU's School of Computer Science is large, 
with multiple departments. Their job ads are typically very general, and 
applications are routed based on the area to relevant departments. [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) 
actually asked [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) if it was even worth sending in an application as "it wasn't 
going to happen." He insisted she apply, which is funny in retrospect. She believes 
that her sincere belief that she wouldn't receive an offer from CMU helped during 
the interview, because she wasn't especially nervous or stressed about messing up.

With one exception, all of my interviews were at schools that were either explicitly hiring in Software Engineering,
or had historical strength in the area.

The exception was a top public research institution in the U.S.. While the call was general, at my interview, 
the department chair told me that software engineering wasn't a designated priority my year. 
*However, he also told me that they reserve about half of their interview spots for exceptional 
candidates, regardless of their specific research subfield.*

In my opinion, if a school that you'd really like to go to doesn't explicitly 
list your area as a priority, 
it can still be worth applying if you believe you're a strong candidate. However, I would still
prioritize calls that explicitly mention your research area.

It is my *personal opinion* that as a software engineering
researcher, where you apply can matter a great deal.  It is "accepted wisdom" in
the community that SE researchers do not receive invitations to interview for
open job calls that do not mention SE (or possibly PL).  By and large, I
observed this to be true.  All but maybe two of my interviews were at places
that listed SE or PL in their job ads explicitly.  One of the exceptions was
Waterloo, which has a long and storied software engineering tradition (as do
most Canadian institutions).

To generalize, I would encourage you to apply to places that you have
reason to believe are interested in your research area, either based on
word-of-mouth or the job ad copy itself.  Examples: in 2012, NC State had an
established SE faculty leave for another position, while UIUC had an established
SE faculty retire.  Both specifically mentioned SE in their 2013 ads.  I
did apply to a few places with "open calls" based on location (and I would
encourage you to do the same), but it mostly didn't pan out.

One more somewhat editorial note: there's typically a subfield that's "hot" in a
given hiring year, such as big data or health care informatics in 2013.  Please
don't pretend to do these things if you don't.  It's tacky and
obvious.

The job search process can be challenging, but by taking it step by step, you can find the right 
fit for your career goals. Now that you know what jobs exist and when and where to apply, the 
next step is to [write and compile
