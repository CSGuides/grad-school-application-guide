# Where Can I Find Specific Jobs?

Now that you know the types of jobs you're looking for, the next 
step is to find actual positions to apply for. Here are some approaches:

- **Word of Mouth**: If you mention that you'll be on the job market,
  people at conferences will tell you if their department is hiring. They 
  may even offer to help ensure your application gets noticed. This approach 
  is more common than you might think; since you're at the same conference 
  they probably like you and the sort of work you do, You can expect a few 
  leads from a major conference. While not required, these connections can 
  be extremely helpful.

  <p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Claire</a> gave two conference talks in the six months before applying for jobs and
  found this approach extremely useful.  She did not end those talks with "I am on
  the job market," but should have in hindsight. 
  </p>

  <p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Madeline</a> attended a conference right before she went on the job market, and she did end her 
  talk with "I am on the job market". Two of her job offers came from 
  institutions where she talked to faculty members afterward.

- **ACM, CRA, and IEEE**: The ACM, CRA, and IEEE Higher Ed maintain
  databases of CS jobs that you can search through.  They also offer 
  mailing lists that send out daily or weekly postings of the latest job 
  ads. However, the information in these postings can sometimes be unclear 
  or inconsistent with what’s on department websites. We recommend using 
  these databases to identify schools that are hiring, and then visiting 
  the department websites to double-check the details.

- **Rankings + Google**:  If you’re applying for academic positions, 
  using department rankings can be a useful strategy. The three most
  popular are from US News & World Report, the CRA Taulbee Survey, and 
  [CSRankings](https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us). Choose the list 
  that best aligns with the types of jobs you’re targeting. Then, visit 
  the websites of departments in the top *n* (where *n* reflects your career 
  goals and qualifications) to check for job postings. Keep in mind that 
  many schools won’t have their ads up until mid-Fall Semester.
  <details><summary>Expand for our recommendations for using this approach:</summary>

  <p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Claire</a> 
   took the top 100 schools on one such list
  and put them in a spreadsheet, with a separate section for Canadian schools.
  She updated the spreadsheet whenever a school posted a job  Before applying, 
  she reviewed the schools that were
  hiring and filtered according to various preferences. She aimed to apply to
  approximately an equal number of schools ranked above and below her graduate
  institution (UVA).
  </p>

  <p><a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Madeline</a> took the union of the top 30 schools from CSRankings and US News 
  & World Report, adding institutions with historical strength in her 
  research area (software engineering). She then filtered schools based 
  on those that were hiring and her geographical preferences.
  </p>

  <p>If you choose a similar approach, we recommend adjusting your starting 
  list and filtering criteria to suit your own goals. Not everyone wants to work
  at a top-ranked school, so don't feel like "top 100" is the only way to go.  For
  example, 
    <a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Claire</a> 
    focused on larger departments, while 
    <a href="/grad-job-guide/about#authors">Madeline</a> preferred
  universities in coastal states within two hours of a major city. You are likely to
  have different preferences.</p>

- **Ask Around**: Your advisor may forward job openings to you, and your recently 
  graduated friends might know of departments that are hiring. Don’t hesitate 
  to reach out and ask.

# How Many Jobs Should I Apply To?

### General Advice

When considering how many jobs to apply to, you'll want to strike a
balance between being strategic and over-applying. Applying to too many 
positions can be overwhelming and may impact the quality of your 
applications. Instead, focus on tailoring your applications to positions that best 
match your skills and career goals. <span class="highlight">The authors of this
document applied to between 15 and 50 positions, with most applying 
to around 25.</span> Specific considerations, 
such as field, job type, and personal circumstances, may influence the 
number of applications you submit.

*Searches for Research Academia Positions:*

* In 2005, [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) applied to 21 places and got 8 interviews and 5 job offers. 
* In 2013, [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) applied to 28 schools and 1 research lab, got 10 invitations to
  interview, went on 9 interviews, and received 8 offers. *[Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) was told by different people at 
  different points in the year that the number of positions to which she applied was (A) far too many, (B) far too few, and (C) exactly right.  Make of that what you will.*
* In 2020, [Kevin](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) and Yu were looking for a joint hire. They applied to 50
  schools, received over 15 interviews each, and got 5 joint academic offers
  (three of which were joint tenure-track positions).
* In 2024, [Madeline](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) applied to 24 schools, got 6 interviews, and received 4 offers. 

*Searches for teaching Academia Positions:*

### Advice for Academic Positions

From our experience applying for programming languages or software engineering
positions, receiving interviews from 25-33% of your places is average and indicates
a well-tailored application list. The strongest candidates may get around 50%. For 
example, the strongest candidate in [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s field-year (in his opinion) applied to 30 
places, received 17 interview offers, went on 15 interviews, and received 7 job offers.

It's important to contextualize these numbers based on the market conditions of the year.
In some years, a particular research topic might be "hot", with many open positions.
In others, the number of available positions might be fewer than then number of strong
candidates. 
For instance, Spring 2005 was highly competitive with many strong applicants in PL/SE, 
while 2013 was more of a candidate's market: the hiring freeze post-financial crisis was
thawing, and the wave of candidates who had started postdocs in 2008 and applied
for faculty positions 2 or 3 years later had thinned.  

Also, while in an ideal world, the schools that you apply to should not depend on the school you got your Ph.D.,
in practice, the rank of your doctoral or post-doctoral institution can have a big impact on where
you ultimately get interviewed or hired. Typically, people get hired by schools that are ranked similarly or
lower than their doctoral institution.
This is not always the case. For example, [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)
was at a school ranked around 20th (UVA), but got hired by a school ranked 1st (CMU). However, this is
the exception rather than the rule. As found by one [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1400005), "only 9 to 14% of faculty are placed at institutions more prestigious than their doctorate". We thus recommend including some schools ranked lower than your doctoral institution on your list.

{% capture quote %}
Based on something like 15 years of observing the market, I feel comfortable
claiming that SE/PL is effectively never "hot".  But, as they fall
squarely into the bread-and-butter category of Computer Science (everyone has to
teach programming!), there appears to be a pretty consistent level of demand in
these areas (subject to prevailing market conditions, of course).

### Advice for Industrial Positions

When applying for industrial research positions, we recommend a slightly different approach:

1. **Cast a Wide Net:** Start by asking everyone you know in your 
  professional network about companies that 
  have hired in the past. Word-of-mouth is often more effective in finding industry 
  positions compared to the more structured academic job market.

2. **Be Open-Minded:** Consider applying to companies that might not initially seem 
  like a perfect fit. Jobs in industry can be more fluid, and you may find a good 
  match once you start talking to people at different companies. It’s beneficial 
  to explore a wide range of companies before narrowing your options.

3. **Understand the Timeline:** The hiring timeline in industry is typically more 
  flexible than academia’s semester-based schedule. Some companies may 
  contact you well into the summer, even after you’ve started a new job. We 
  recommend starting the search very early and contacting people at each potential 
  employer to get an idea for how often and when they tend to hire.  

### Special Considerations

The general guidelines above should be adjusted based on your specific 
situation. For example:

* **Non-Standard Fields:** If you’re in a specialized area like HCI or
  computational biology, the application numbers could differ significantly. In
  addition, If your work spans more than one subfield, carefully consider the way you
  position yourself and your work.  Departments have areas in mind when they
  interview and assign applications to faculty in specific areas for
  batch-processing.  For example, [Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors)'s publication record was fairly
  evenly split between evolutionary computation and software engineering venues.
  However, she considers herself primarily an SE researcher, and wanted to be
  considered as such as an applicant.  She thus pitched herself as an "SE person"
  who borrows insights from other fields (evolutionary computation/GP) as opposed
  to a person who floats in the void between research areas. 
  We talk more generally about the impact of your research area on where you apply
  [here](#academic-positions-research-area-and-where-to-apply).

* **Two-Body Problem:** If you and your partner are both 
  seeking academic positions at the same or nearby institutions, 
  you will likely need to apply to at least 40 places, 
  with some couples applying to as many as 60.

{% capture quote %} 
As my wife and I were both trying to find academic positions together in
the same department, we applied broadly to over 50 institutions.
We made a large spreadsheet of all the academic job postings we could
find (including word-of-mouth, CRA, twitter posts, etc.) and categorized
them based on area and whether we could fit together (e.g., neither of
us do theory, so we dropped schools considering only theory
researchers).  We found a few schools doing cluster hires which were
very helpful in our dual career search.  

We each had more than 15 full interviews, most of which were at overlapping
institutions. I applied as a "cross-disciplinary" researcher with papers
in security, dependability, software engineering, and NLP.  I was almost
universally treated as a cybersecurity researcher by every department
that interviewed me.   In retrospect, I believe departments make
decisions to interview based (in part) on specific needs in fields
(e.g., security, software engineering, AI).  I don't think it was
harmful to portray myself as someone that worked across disciplines, but
some of those interviewing me seemed to want to focus on a specific area
in any case. 

I applied both to teaching-track and tenure-track positions.   Together,
we received 5 official joint academic offers, 3 of which were joint
tenure-track positions.  We also received another 3 verbal offers for
joint tenure-track positions.
