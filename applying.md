# I've Decided to Apply! What Now?

<span class="highlight">Once you’ve decided to apply to graduate school, the next step is 
to identify which programs to target and prepare your application materials.</span>

In this section, we’ll cover two key parts of the process:

1. **Identifying Schools:** how to choose which graduate programs to apply to, 
including strategies for balancing “reach,” “target,” and “safety” schools.  
2. **Writing Application Essays:** how to approach statements of purpose, personal statements, 
and other written materials effectively.

Each subsection includes practical advice, quotes from students and faculty, and examples to guide your preparation.  
*More examples are available on the [Example Materials](exampleMaterials.md) tab.*
