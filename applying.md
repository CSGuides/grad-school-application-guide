# What Materials Do You Need?

<span class="highlight">Now that you know what jobs exist, as well as when 
and where to apply, it's time to prepare your application materials!</span>

Your applications will almost certainly require the following materials:

1. References or [Letters of Recommendation](#letters-of-recommendation) (three to five)
2. A [Cover Letter](#cover-letter)
3. A [CV or Resume](#preparing-your-resume)
4. A [Research Statement](#research-statement)

Many positions will also ask for:

5. A [Teaching Statement](#teaching-statement) (required for academic applications)
6. A [Diversity Statement](#diversity-statement)
7. Three [Indicative Publications](#selecting-indicative-publications)

Some international universities have extremely structured templates, 
such as this 
<a href="https://www.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.695604.1703153880!/CV%20template%20for%20the%20employment%20and%20promotion%20of%20teachers_s_231201.docx">"CV template for the employment and promotion of teachers"</a>
from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. 

*On the rest of this tab, weâ€™ll provide an overview and tips to help you get started on each part of your application.* 

We also include select examples of successful materials from each category. *More examples are available
