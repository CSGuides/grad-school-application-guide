This guide was written by [Wes Weimer](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/) (University of
Michigan), [Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/) (Carnegie Mellon University), Zak Fry (GrammaTech),

Kevin Angstadt and Madeline Endres are the primary
maintainers of this version of the guide (there are older versions out
there, but we anticipate this site to be most up-to-date).

# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to this guide.  The repository is
[hosted on GitHub]({{site.repo}}). If you have any questions about contributing, please email Madeline Endres at <mendres@umass.edu>.

## Contributing Application Materials

We are always looking for more application material profiles, especially for job-types or job-locations that are currently under-represented in our guide. These materials are hosted on the [Example Materials tab](exampleMaterials.md), and can help students contextualize their application and deal with imposter syndrome. 

If you are interesting in contributing your materials, please fill out our contribution form available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLHwzuCsOcKHNBZBO9LGiWhVZPbcIE5-VpQ5hL8wQcFRAAMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). This form includes places to upload PDFs of your materials, as well as add any information you'd like to better contextualize your application for readers. In this form, you can also indicate if you'd like to be kept anonymous. All materials are optional -- we greatly appreciate anything you'd be willing to share!

## Problems with the Website

Did you notice something wrong with the website (something not working or a
typo)?  Please [create an issue]({{site.repo}}/issues) on our GitHub project.

# Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge all of our colleagues who have aided (directly and
indirectly) in the creation of this guide. You may safely assume that all of the
good ideas here come from them and that all bad advice comes from us.

Many wise and wonderful people were kind enough to grant Wes the boon of their
wisdom on this subject. They include, but are not limited to:

- Alex Aiken (Stanford)
- Ras Bodik (Berkeley)
- Katherine Compton (Wisconsin)
- Richard Fateman (Berkeley)
- Jill Findeis (PSU)
- Stephen Freund (Williams)
- Patrice Godefroid (Bell Labs)
- Sumit Gulwani (Microsoft)
- Tom Henzinger (EPFL)
- Ranjit Jhala (UCSD)
- Iain Keddie (IBM)
- Jim Larus (Microsoft)
- David Liben-Nowell (Carleton)
- Tessa Lau (IBM)
- Rupak Majumdar (UCLA)
- Wayne McMullen (PSU)
- Greg Morrisett (Harvard)
- George Necula (Berkeley)
- Jens Palsberg (UCLA)
- Sriram Rajamani (Microsoft)
- David Shoenthal (Longwood)
- Raj Varma (Delaware)
- Mark Wegman (IBM)
- Donna Weimer (Juniata)

[Claire](/grad-job-guide/about#authors) did not consult many people for her contributions to this document, as
she modified it after it had long been written. However, beyond [Wes](/grad-job-guide/about#authors), she would
particularly like to acknowledge the support and assistance of:

- Katie Stolee (Iowa State)
- Yuriy Brun (UMass-Amherst)
- Reid Holmes (Waterloo)
- Ivan Beschastnikh (UBC)
- Stephanie Forrest (UNM)
- John Knight (UVA)

... and the many others who offered advice and support throughout her own job
search.

Zak had a similarly short list of consultations, as he targeted exclusively
industrial research positions and arguably had a more "homogeneous" job search
experience overall:

- Wes Weimer (UVA)
- Lori Pollock (UD)
- Stephanie Forrest (UNM)
- John Knight (UVA)
- Pieter Hooimeijer (Facebook)
- Ray Buse (Google)
- Joel Coffman (Johns Hopkins APL)
