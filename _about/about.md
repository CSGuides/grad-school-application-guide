# Authors

This guide was primarily written by [Wes Weimer](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/) (tenured full professor at the University of Michigan), [Madeline Endres](https://madelineendres.com) (tenure-track assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst), [Priscila Santiesteban](https://pasantiesteban.github.io/ps.gitbub.io/) (PhD-track graduate student at the University of Michigan), and [Kevin Angstadt](https://myslu.stlawu.edu/~kangstadt/) (tenure-track associate professor at St. Lawrence University). It builds on a guide structure co-designed by [Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/) (tenured full professor at Carnegie Mellon University) and organized and maintained by Kevin Angstadt. 

In this Guide, we generally offer collective advice and speak in general terms. However, we will sometimes refer to specific authors by name. We provide
information about each author's search below to provide context.

* [Wes Weimer](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/): Completed his PhD in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, later joining the University of Virginia as a faculty member. He is now a tenured professor at the University of Michigan.

* [Madeline Endres](https://madelineendres.com): Completed her PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan and, in 2024, pursued academic research positions before joining the University of Massachusetts Amherst as a tenure-track assistant professor.

* [Priscila Santiesteban](https://pasantiesteban.github.io/ps.gitbub.io/) Is completing her PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan and plans to pursue faculty positions upon graduation.

* [Kevin Angstadt](https://myslu.stlawu.edu/~kangstadt/): Completed his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Michigan and joined St. Lawrence University as a tenure-track assistant professor in 2019.

* [Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/):Completed her PhD in Computer Science at the University of Virginia and joined Carnegie Mellon University as a tenure-track assistant professor in 2013. She has since served multiple times on, and chaired, the faculty hiring committee in her department, [S3D](https://s3d.cmu.edu/).



Priscila Santiesteban and Madeline Endres are the primary
maintainers of this version of the guide (there are older versions out
there, but we anticipate this site to be most up-to-date).

## Contributing Application Materials

We are always looking for more application material profiles, especially for job-types or job-locations that are currently under-represented in our guide. These materials are hosted on the [Example Materials tab](exampleMaterials.md), and can help students contextualize their application and deal with imposter syndrome. 

If you are interesting in contributing your materials, please fill out our contribution form available [TBA](). This form includes places to upload PDFs of your materials, as well as add any information you'd like to better contextualize your application for readers. In this form, you can also indicate if you'd like to be kept anonymous. All materials are optional -- we greatly appreciate anything you'd be willing to share!

## Problems with the Website
